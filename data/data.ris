AB  - Grain production plays an important role in the global economy. In this sense, the demand for efficient and safe methods of food production is increasing. Information Technology is one of the tools to that end. Among the available tools, we highlight computer vision solutions combined with artificial intelligence algorithms that achieved important results in the detection of patterns in images. In this context, this work presents a systematic review that aims to identify the applicability of computer vision in precision agriculture for the production of the five most produced grains in the world: maize, rice, wheat, soybean, and barley. In this sense, we present 25 papers selected in the last five years with different approaches to treat aspects related to disease detection, grain quality, and phenotyping. From the results of the systematic review, it is possible to identify great opportunities, such as the exploitation of GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and advanced artificial intelligence techniques, such as DBN (Deep Belief Networks) in the construction of robust methods of computer vision applied to precision agriculture.

AB  - Agriculture contributes to a major share in the Indian economy and most of its people are dependent on it for their livelihood. This makes water an important resource that needs to be preserved using the latest available technologies. Apart from being fundamental in industry 4.0, IoT also extends its capability to smart farming. Work proposed here targets to develop a low cost intelligent system for smart irrigation. It uses IoT to make devices used in the system to talk and connect on their own, with capabilities like: admin mode for user interaction, one-time setup for irrigation schedule estimation, neural based decision making for intelligent support and remote data monitoring. A sample crop test-bed has been chosen to present results of the proposed system, that include irrigation schedule, neural net decision making and remote data viewing. Neural network provides required intelligence to the device that considers current sensor input and masks the irrigation schedule for efficient irrigation. The system uses MQTT and HTTP to keep the user informed about the current crop situation even from a distant location. The proposed system proves beneficial with its intelligence, low cost and portability, making it suitable for greenhouse, farms, etc.

AB  - The precise estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is crucial for the planning and management of water resources and agricultural production. In this study, the applicability of the Hargreaves Samani (HS), artificial neural network (ANN), multiple linear regression (MLR) and extreme learning machine (ELM) models were evaluated to estimate ET0 based on temperature data from the Verde Grande River basin, southeastern Brazil. These models were evaluated in two scenarios: local and pooled. In the local scenario, training, calibration and validation of the models were performed separately at each station. In the pooled scenario, meteorological data from all stations were grouped for training and calibration and then separately tested at each station. The ET0 values estimated by the Penman-Monteith model (FAO-56 PM) were considered the target data. All the developed models were evaluated by cluster analysis and the following performance indices: relative root mean square error (RRMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS). In both scenarios evaluated, local and pooled, the results revealed the superiority of the artificial intelligence methods (ANN and ELM) and the MLR model compared to the original and adjusted HS models. In the local scenario, the ANN (with r of 0.751, NS of 0.687 and RRMSE of 0.112), ELM (with r of 0.747, NS of 0.672 and RRMSE of 0.116) and MLR (with r of 0.743, NS of 0.665 and RRMSE of 0.068) models presented the best performance, in addition to being grouped in the same cluster. Similar to the observations from the local scenario, the ANN (with r of 0.718, NS of 0.555 and RRMSE of 0.165), ELM (with r of 0.724, NS of 0.601 and RRMSE of 0.151) and MLR (with r of 0.731, NS of 0.550 and RRMSE of 0.091) models presented the best performance in the pooled scenario and were grouped in the same cluster. The locally trained models presented higher precision than the models generated with pooled data; however, the models generated in the pooled scenario could be used to estimate ET0 in cases of unavailability of local meteorological data. Although the MLR, ANN and ELM models, based on temperature data, are appropriate alternatives to accurately estimate ET0 in the Verde Grande River basin, southeastern Brazil, the MLR model presents the advantage of the use of explicit algebraic equations, facilitating its application.

AB  - Irrigation is very important for ensuring food security and reducing crop production vulnerability caused by the lack of rain. Sustainable irrigation is the rational practice of all the activities related to water application on the crops. In irrigation, the rationality of intelligent agents can be used to reach soil water content near the field capacity to increase yields and reduce waste of water. Rationality in artificial intelligence is the capability of the intelligent agents to decide their actions. This paper discusses how incorporating intelligent agents on irrigation systems allows significant advances in respect of current irrigation approaches. This paper review not only focuses on intelligent reactive systems as usual, but rather discloses developments in systems that incorporate other behaviors such as proactivity, planning, learning, social abilities, organization, coordination and negotiation. From the literature review, it is found that the use of soil, plant and environmental sensors, as well as reasoning, learning and communication capabilities, provides innovative technological support to improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows that intelligent agents can adequately consider the timing and the amount of water to apply according to the spatio-temporal variations of the soil–plant–atmosphere system. It is concluded that significant improvements in water savings and crop yield can be achieved incorporating artificial intelligence into precision irrigation. Further research is needed on irrigation scheduling based on multi-agent systems at different scales of agricultural production systems.

AB  - In the current era, water is a significant resource for socio-economic growth and the protection of healthy environments. Properly controlled water resources are considered a vital part of development, which reduces poverty and equity. Conventional Water system Management maximizes the existing water flows available to satisfy all competing demands, including on-site water and groundwater. Therefore, Climatic change would intensify the specific challenges in water resource management by contributing to uncertainty. Sustainable water resources management is an essential process for ensuring the earth's life and the future. Nonlinear effects, stochastic dynamics, and hydraulic constraints are challenging in ecological planning for sustainable water development. In this paper, Adaptive Intelligent Dynamic Water Resource Planning (AIDWRP) has been proposed to sustain the urban areas' water environment. Here, an adaptive intelligent approach is a subset of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique in which environmental planning for sustainable water development has been modeled effectively. Artificial intelligence modeling improves water efficiency by transforming information into a leaner process, improving decision-making based on data-driven by combining numeric AI tools and human intellectual skills. In AIDWRP, Markov Decision Process (MDP) discusses the dynamic water resource management issue with annual use and released locational constraints that develop sensitivity-driven methods to optimize several efficient environmental planning and management policies. Consequently, there is a specific relief from the engagement of supply and demand for water resources, and substantial improvements in local economic efficiency have been simulated with numerical outcomes.

AB  - The conventional sprinkler irrigation time calculation does not consider current soil moisture, leading to inadequate or excess irrigation due to daily weather changes. In present study, a new approach for calculating sprinkler irrigation time was proposed, which used in-field soil moisture values obtained by a convolutional neural network (CNN). To enhance accuracy and limit its size, the CNN architecture incorporated depth-wise separable convolution and residual connections. A deep-learning-based mobile application was developed, which predicted soil moisture class via in-field soil images, crop factors, and sprinkler system details. The system was assessed based on soil moisture class prediction accuracy, energy usage, water savings, and water productivity. The CNN model had an average classification accuracy of 97.10%, precision of 85.50%, recall of 86.80%, F1-score of 85.80%, and true prediction score of 75.30%. The developed mobile application saved 27.59% water and 27.42% energy by accurately estimating irrigation time using the predicted soil moisture class. The developed system corrected conventional irrigation depth in some instances, thereby reducing crop yield losses due to inadequate water supply. Compared to conventional sprinkler irrigation, the developed system increased water productivity by 32.75%. Thus, the system has the potential to conserve water and energy while improving crop yield.

AB  - The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been evident in the agricultural sector recently. The sector faces numerous challenges in order to maximize its yield including improper soil treatment, disease and pest infestation, big data requirements, low output, and knowledge gap between farmers and technology. The main concept of AI in agriculture is its flexibility, high performance, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. This paper presents a review of the applications of AI in soil management, crop management, weed management and disease management. A special focus is laid on the strength and limitations of the application and the way in utilizing expert systems for higher productivity.

AB  - [1] The competition for existing freshwater supplies will require a paradigmatic shift from maximizing productivity per unit of land area to maximizing productivity per unit of water consumed. This shift will, in turn, demand broad systems approaches that physically and biologically optimize irrigation relative to water delivery and application schemes, rainfall, critical growth stages, soil fertility, location, and weather. Water can be conserved at a watershed or regional level for other uses only if evaporation, transpiration, or both are reduced and unrecoverable losses to unusable sinks are minimized (e.g., salty groundwater or oceans). Agricultural advances will include implementation of crop location strategies, conversion to crops with higher economic value or productivity per unit of water consumed, and adoption of alternate drought-tolerant crops. Emerging computerized GPS-based precision irrigation technologies for self-propelled sprinklers and microirrigation systems will enable growers to apply water and agrochemicals more precisely and site specifically to match soil and plant status and needs as provided by wireless sensor networks. Agriculturalists will need to exercise flexibility in managing the rate, frequency, and duration of water supplies to successfully allocate limited water and other inputs to crops. The most effective means to conserve water appears to be through carefully managed deficit irrigation strategies that are supported by advanced irrigation system and flexible, state-of-the-art water delivery systems. Nonagricultural water users will need to exercise patience as tools reflecting the paradigmatic shift are actualized. Both groups will need to cooperate and compromise as they practice more conservative approaches to freshwater consumption.

AB  - Wind drift and evaporation losses (WDEL), which can occur as a result of operational and meteorological factors, are two of the most significant sprinkler-irrigation losses that can occur even in a well-managed irrigation system. A proper understanding of factors that influence WDEL in sprinkle irrigation is critical for developing water conservation strategies that significantly impact the quality and return on investment of irrigation projects. The specific objective of this research was to determine the predictive ability of five soft computing approaches (artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), probabilistic linear regression (PLR), and support vector regression (SVR)) for predicting WDEL on a sprinkler irrigation system under design, operational, and meteorological conditions. Datasets were collected from previously published studies conducted under a variety of conditions. The results showed that the five approaches yielded statistically different WDEL predictions. The ANN model produced the most accurate WDEL predictions compared to the other models with the training and testing dataset. The ANFIS, MARS, PLR, and SVR models' performance ranks were found to be inconsistent across a variety of statistical performance criteria. Hence, Shannon's entropy-based decision theory was used to rank these models. The MARS model was ranked second (0.896), followed by the ANFIS model (0.865), the PLR model (0.833), and the SVR model (0.794). The design variable “auxiliary nozzle diameter” and climate variable “wind speed” both had high contribution ratios (17.5% and 12.19%, respectively) in WDEL modeling to produce a robust predictive model. In general, the developed models, particularly the ANN model, demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in estimating the WDEL of sprinkler irrigation systems.

AB  - In the field of agriculture, the water used for irrigation should be given special treatment, as it is responsible for a large proportion of total water consumption. Irrigation scheduling is critical to food production because it guarantees producers a consistent harvest and minimizes the risk of losses due to water shortages. Therefore, the creation of an automatic irrigation method using new technologies is essential. New methods such as deep learning algorithms have attracted a lot of attention in agriculture and are already being used successfully. In this work, a Deep Q-Network was trained for irrigation scheduling. The agent was trained to schedule irrigation for a tomato field in Portugal. Two Long Short Term Memory models were used as the agent environment. One predicts the total water in the soil profile on the next day. The other one was employed to estimate the yield based on the environmental condition during a season and then measure the net return. The agent uses this information to decide the following irrigation amount. An Artificial Neural Network, a Long Short Term Memory, and a Convolutional Neural Network were used to estimating the Q-table during training. Unlike the Long-Short Terms Memory model, the Artificial Neural Network and the Convolutional Neural Network could not estimate the Q-table, and the agent's reward decreased during training. The comparison of the performance of the model was done with fixed base irrigation and threshold based irrigation. The trained model increased productivity by 11% and decreased water consumption by 20–30% compared to the fixed method.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) represents technologies with human-like cognitive abilities to learn, perform, and make decisions. AI in precision agriculture (PA) enables farmers and farm managers to deploy highly targeted and precise farming practices based on site-specific agroclimatic field measurements. The foundational and applied development of AI has matured considerably over the last 30 years. The time is now right to engage seriously with the ethics and responsible practice of AI for the well-being of farmers and farm managers. In this paper, we identify and discuss both challenges and opportunities for improving farmers’ trust in those providing AI solutions for PA. We highlight that farmers’ trust can be moderated by how the benefits and risks of AI are perceived, shared, and distributed. We propose four recommendations for improving farmers’ trust. First, AI developers should improve model transparency and explainability. Second, clear responsibility and accountability should be assigned to AI decisions. Third, concerns about the fairness of AI need to be overcome to improve human-machine partnerships in agriculture. Finally, regulation and voluntary compliance of data ownership, privacy, and security are needed, if AI systems are to become accepted and used by farmers.

AB  - Concerns about scarcity of water have focused attention on irrigation, the largest water-using sector worldwide, which is widely seen as a low-value, wasteful and "inefficient" use for water. The terminology for this debate is, however, poorly defined - often failing even to distinguish between consumptive and non-consumptive uses. In consequence, technical interventions have not always led to the expected, desirable outcomes, and the recommendations in many reports and papers are at best dubious, at worst simply wrong. The history of the analysis of "irrigation efficiency" is traced, and compared with the science of hydrology, which offers consistent terminology for various scales of analysis from field through irrigation scheme to region and basin. Based on the work of various previous writers, an analytical framework and associated terms are proposed to better serve the needs of technical specialists from all water-using sectors, policymakers and planners in achieving more productive use of water and tracing the implications of interventions on other uses and users. ICID recommends that this terminology be used in the analysis of water resources management at all scales, and form the basis for its research papers and other published outputs.

AB  - This work addresses task planning under uncertainty for precision agriculture applications whereby task costs are uncertain and the gain of completing a task is proportional to resource consumption (such as water consumption in precision irrigation). The goal is to complete all tasks while prioritizing those that are more urgent, and subject to diverse budget thresholds and stochastic costs for tasks. To describe agriculture-related environments that incorporate stochastic costs to complete tasks, a new Stochastic-Vertex-Cost Aisle Graph (SAG) is introduced. Then, a task allocation algorithm, termed Next-Best-Action Planning (NBA-P), is proposed. NBA-P utilizes the underlying structure enabled by SAG, and tackles the task planning problem by simultaneously determining the optimal tasks to perform and an optimal time to exit (i.e. return to a base station), at run-time. The proposed approach is tested with both simulated data and real-world experimental datasets collected in a commercial vineyard, in both single- and multi-robot scenarios. In all cases, NBA-P outperforms other evaluated methods in terms of return per visited vertex, wasted resources resulting from aborted tasks (i.e. when a budget threshold is exceeded), and total visited vertices.

AB  - Accurate yield estimation and optimised nitrogen management is essential in agriculture. Remote sensing (RS) systems are being more widely used in building decision support tools for contemporary farming systems to improve yield production and nitrogen management while reducing operating costs and environmental impact. However, RS based approaches require processing of enormous amounts of remotely sensed data from different platforms and, therefore, greater attention is currently being devoted to machine learning (ML) methods. This is due to the capability of machine learning based systems to process a large number of inputs and handle non-linear tasks. This paper discusses research developments conducted within the last 15 years on machine learning based techniques for accurate crop yield prediction and nitrogen status estimation. The paper concludes that the rapid advances in sensing technologies and ML techniques will provide cost-effective and comprehensive solutions for better crop and environment state estimation and decision making. More targeted application of the sensor platforms and ML techniques, the fusion of different sensor modalities and expert knowledge, and the development of hybrid systems combining different ML and signal processing techniques are all likely to be part of precision agriculture (PA) in the near future.

AB  - Rainfall forecasting has gained utmost research relevance in recent times due to its complexities and persistentapplications such as flood forecasting and monitoring of pollutant concentration levels, among others. Existingmodels use complex statistical models that are often too costly, both computationally and budgetary, orare not applied to downstream applications. Therefore, approaches that use Machine Learning algorithmsin conjunction with time-series data are being explored as an alternative to overcome these drawbacks.To this end, this study presents a comparative analysis using simplified rainfall estimation models basedon conventional Machine Learning algorithms and Deep Learning architectures that are efficient for thesedownstream applications. Models based on LSTM, Stacked-LSTM, Bidirectional-LSTM Networks, XGBoost, andan ensemble of Gradient Boosting Regressor, Linear Support Vector Regression, and an Extra-trees Regressorwere compared in the task of forecasting hourly rainfall volumes using time-series data. Climate data from2000 to 2020 from five major cities in the United Kingdom were used. The evaluation metrics of Loss, RootMean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error were used to evaluatethe models’ performance. Results show that a Bidirectional-LSTM Network can be used as a rainfall forecastmodel with comparable performance to Stacked-LSTM Networks. Among all the models tested, the Stacked-LSTM Network with two hidden layers and the Bidirectional-LSTM Network performed best. This suggeststhat models based on LSTM-Networks with fewer hidden layers perform better for this approach; denoting itsability to be applied as an approach for budget-wise rainfall forecast applications.

AB  - In this paper, we apply an optimal LQ controller, which has an inherent structure that allows for a distributed implementation, to an irrigation network. The network consists of a water reservoir and connected water canals. The goal is to keep the levels close to the set-points when farmers take out water. The LQ controller is designed using a first-order approximation of the canal dynamics, while the simulation model used for evaluation uses third-order canal dynamics. The performance is compared to a P controller and an LQ controller designed using the third-order canal dynamics. The structured controller outperforms the P controller and is close to the theoretical optimum given by the third-order LQ controller for disturbance rejection.

AB  - Efficient water resources management is an issue of major importance in the field of sustainable development, especially in the agricultural sector which represents the main consumer through irrigations. Therefore irrigation management is an important and innovating area which was the subject of several research and studies. Modeling, and more particularly, the Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), allows better representing the multiplicity of these actors, the diversity of their roles and their interactions. The main reason why we chose the agent technology in the field of gravity irrigation systems, is the complexity to manage in real-time the water distribution operations those arrive asynchronously and dynamically and to be reactive and adaptive to the dynamic and unpredictable events that characterizes the field (mainly rainy advents). Our objectives are mainly located on two levels. The first one, concerns the gravity irrigation modeling by a multi-agent technology and the agent modeling through AML language. The second one focuses on the irrigations scheduling optimization using an evolutionary algorithm. Comparisons between schedules before and after optimization are made and the results shows that our approach can be considered as an efficient tool for planning irrigation schedules by considering crops water needs.

AB  - Although the use of new tools and technology for irrigation is becoming more popular, the use of methodology such as evapotranspiration to determine the irrigation amount is relatively old and may result in over or under irrigation. Since crop water requirement is function of many parameters, a thorough study is thus required to determine more important parameters that contribute to estimating crop water requirement. These important parameters then can be used to develop an artificial intelligence model, which is expected to be predicting the crop water requirement with minimum errors. The methodology to predict the crop water requirement presented in this paper consists of the following steps: (a) collecting field and weather data, (b) classifying soil moisture data to estimate crop water requirement, (c) identifying important input variables for the crop water requirement by correlation analysis, and (d) developing artificial intelligence models to predict crop water requirement using the important parameters identified in the previous step. The methodology has been applied to analyze olive field data at the University Agricultural Laboratory (UAL) at California State University Fresno. Results show that past PSM (positive change in soil moisture) data can be used to predict future crop water requirement. Besides PSM, soil temperature (ST) and cumulative evapotranspiration (CET) show higher correlation when they are used as a single input variable for the neural network model at lags 3 days and 11 days respectively. When two input variables are used to train the network, the combination of ST and PSM; and SR (solar radiation) and ST at lags 3 days and 6 days show better performance.

AB  - Plant classification is vital for ecological conservation and agricultural productivity, enhancing our understanding of plant growth dynamics and aiding species preservation. The advent of deep learning (DL) techniques has revolutionized this field by enabling autonomous feature extraction, significantly reducing the dependence on manual expertise. However, conventional DL models often rely solely on single data sources, failing to capture the full biological diversity of plant species comprehensively. Recent research has turned to multimodal learning to overcome this limitation by integrating multiple data types, which enriches the representation of plant characteristics. This shift introduces the challenge of determining the optimal point for modality fusion. In this paper, we introduce a pioneering multimodal DL-based approach for plant classification with automatic modality fusion. Utilizing the multimodal fusion architecture search, our method integrates images from multiple plant organs-flowers, leaves, fruits, and stems-into a cohesive model. Our method achieves 83.48% accuracy on 956 classes of the PlantCLEF2015 dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. It outperforms late fusion by 11.07% and is more robust to missing modalities. We validate our model against established benchmarks using standard performance metrics and McNemar's test, further underscoring its superiority.

AB  - Assessing the impact of climate change (CC) on agricultural production systems is mainly done using crop models associated with climate model outputs. This review is one of the few, with the main objective of providing a recent compendium of CC impact studies on irrigation needs and rice yields for a better understanding and use of climate and crop models. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of climate impact studies on agricultural production systems, with a particular focus on uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of crop models. Although the new generation global climate models (GCMs) are more robust than previous ones, there is still a need to consider the effect of climate uncertainty on estimates when using them. Current GCMs cannot directly simulate the agro-climatic variables of interest for future irrigation assessment, hence the use of intelligent climate tools. Therefore, sensitivity and uncertainty analyses must be applied to crop models, especially for their calibration under different conditions. The impacts of CC on irrigation needs and rice yields vary across regions, seasons, varieties and crop models. Finally, integrated assessments, the use of remote sensing data, climate smart tools, CO2 enrichment experiments, consideration of changing crop management practices and multi-scale crop modeling, seem to be the approaches to be pursued for future climate impact assessments for agricultural systems.

AB  - Soil moisture is a key hydrological parameter that has significant importance to human society and the environment. Accurate modeling and monitoring of soil moisture in crop fields, especially in the root zone (top 100 cm of soil), is essential for improving agricultural production and crop yield with the help of precision irrigation and farming tools. Realizing the full sensor data potential depends greatly on advanced analytical and predictive domain-aware models. In this work, we propose a physics-constrained deep learning (P-DL) framework to integrate physics-based principles on water transport and water sensing signals for effective reconstruction of the soil moisture dynamics. We adopt three different optimizers, namely Adam, RMSprop, and GD, to minimize the loss function of P-DL during the training process. In the illustrative case study, we demonstrate the empirical convergence of Adam optimizers outperforms the other optimization methods in both mini-batch and full-batch training.

AB  - Indonesia is one of the biggest agriculture countries in the world with one of its major commodities, rice. Despite its vast paddy field and tropical resources, Indonesia still has not achieved food security. This paper explores ideas about how to present artificial intelligence that may increase rice productivity in Indonesia. Current situations of rice cultivation are mentioned start from existing technologies and systems used in Indonesia. Some artificial intelligence concepts are also introduced. Artificial Intelligence use in rice farming is then analyzed which ideas may be applicable to increase efficiency further. Those that are already implemented in rice farming include diseases and pest detection, prediction and estimation, and automated intelligent systems. In the proposed idea section, ideas to increase production are explored. Using advanced technologies may not be suitable for Indonesia's rice farmers. One argument is to minimize the differences in rice yield in different areas or so what we called yield gap. Factors such as weather, water, and harvest date are those with most impacts on the yield gap. It is beneficial to have a model that can predict the optimal planting date of rice since that will maximize the factors before. Among those implemented, a planting calendar prediction on rice-based on rainfall is already developed. However, rainfall is not the only factor. El-Nino occurrences and temperature changes also have a role in deciding when best to plant rice. The author suggests adding those two new variables, making three in total to the earlier neural network model may improve the overall result.

AB  - In recent years, deep artificial neural networks (including recurrent ones) have won numerous contests in pattern recognition and machine learning. This historical survey compactly summarises relevant work, much of it from the previous millennium. Shallow and deep learners are distinguished by the depth of their credit assignment paths, which are chains of possibly learnable, causal links between actions and effects. I review deep supervised learning (also recapitulating the history of backpropagation), unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning & evolutionary computation, and indirect search for short programs encoding deep and large networks.

AB  - Many broadacre farmers have a time series of crop yield monitor data for their fields which are often augmented with additional data, such as soil apparent electrical conductivity surveys and soil test results. In addition there are now readily available national and global datasets, such as rainfall and MODIS, which can be used to represent the crop-growing environment. Rather than analysing one field at a time as is typical in precision agriculture research, there is an opportunity to explore the value of combining data over multiple fields/farms and years into one dataset. Using these datasets in conjunction with machine learning approaches allows predictive models of crop yield to be built. In this study, several large farms in Western Australia were used as a case study, and yield monitor data from wheat, barley and canola crops from three different seasons (2013, 2014 and 2015) that covered ~ 11 000 to ~ 17 000 hectares in each year were used. The yield data were processed to a 10 m grid, and for each observation point associated predictor variables in space and time were collated. The data were then aggregated to a 100 m spatial resolution for modelling yield. Random forest models were used to predict crop yield of wheat, barley and canola using this dataset. Three separate models were created based on pre-sowing, mid-season and late-season conditions to explore the changes in the predictive ability of the model as more within-season information became available. These time points also coincide with points in the season when a management decision is made, such as the application of fertiliser. The models were evaluated with cross-validation using both fields and years for data splitting, and this was assessed at the field spatial resolution. Cross-validated results showed the models predicted yield relatively accurately, with a root mean square error of 0.36 to 0.42 t ha−1, and a Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient of 0.89 to 0.92 at the field resolution. The models performed better as the season progressed, largely because more information about within-season data became available (e.g. rainfall). The more years of yield data that were available for a field, the better the predictions were, and future work should use a longer time-series of yield data. The generic nature of this method makes it possible to apply to other agricultural systems where yield monitor data is available. Future work should also explore the integration of more data sources into the models, focus on predicting at finer spatial resolutions within fields, and the possibility of using the yield forecasts to guide management decisions.

AB  - Crop management, including nitrogen (N) fertilization and irrigation management, has a significant impact on the crop yield, economic profit, and the environment. Although management guidelines exist, it is challenging to find the optimal management practices given a specific planting environment and a crop. Previous work used reinforcement learning (RL) and crop simulators to solve the problem, but the trained policies either have limited performance or are not deployable in the real world. In this paper, we present an intelligent crop management system which optimizes the N fertilization and irrigation simultaneously via RL, imitation learning (IL), and crop simulations using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). We first use deep RL, in particular, deep Q-network, to train management policies that require all state information from the simulator as observations (denoted as full observation). We then invoke IL to train management policies that only need a limited amount of state information that can be readily obtained in the real world (denoted as partial observation) by mimicking the actions of the previously RL-trained policies under full observation. We conduct experiments on a case study using maize in Florida and compare trained policies with a maize management guideline in simulations. Our trained policies under both full and partial observations achieve better outcomes, resulting in a higher profit or a similar profit with a smaller environmental impact. Moreover, the partial-observation management policies are directly deployable in the real world as they use readily available information.

AB  - Population growth and increasing droughts are creating unprecedented strain on the continued availability of water resources. Since irrigation is a major consumer of fresh water, wastage of resources in this sector could have strong consequences. To address this issue, irrigation water management and prediction techniques need to be employed effectively and should be able to account for the variabilities present in the environment. The different techniques surveyed in this paper can be classified into two categories: computational and statistical. Computational methods deal with scientific correlations between physical parameters whereas statistical methods involve specific prediction algorithms that can be used to automate the process of irrigation water prediction. These algorithms interpret semantic relationships between the various parameters of temperature, pressure, evapotranspiration etc. and store them as numerical precomputed entities specific to the conditions and the area used as the data for the training corpus used to train it. We focus on reviewing the computational methods used to determine Evapotranspiration and its implications. We compare the efficiencies of different data mining and machine learning methods implemented in this area, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tress Classifier, SysFor, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Fuzzy Logic techniques, Artifical Neural Networks(ANNs) and various hybrids of Genetic Algorithms (GA) applied to irrigation prediction. We also recommend a possible technique for the same based on its superior results in other such time series analysis tasks. INTRODUCTION:

AB  - The water scarcity challenge has become a global threat to food security and the entire agricultural value chain at large. Saving water is the most strenuous challenge for farmers prompting the need for smart irrigation infrastructure upgrades. To predict the best time to irrigate or not, farmers utilize information such as soil type, available water resources, soil moisture, and climate conditions to make decisions that solve agricultural complexity. Deploying field sensors using IoT, a data-driven technology, requires the combination of emerging technologies and modern methodologies to provide solutions to the complex problems faced by agriculture. IoT has facilitated the gathering of information over a long period, and since information is accessible, the implementation of 4IR in the sector of agriculture to machine learning and Logistic Regression identifies several perceptions that lead to the solution for a complex problem. This article proposes a 4IR-enabled Smart Irrigation System that minimizes water usage within the agriculture sector to assist farmers in getting live data of soil moisture, weather API, the water capacity of different crops, and plugging sensors to predict when farmers can irrigate or not.

AB  - An accurate and precise understanding of global irrigation usage is crucial for a variety of climate science efforts. Irrigation is highly energy-intensive, and as population growth continues at its current pace, increases in crop need and water usage will have an impact on climate change. Precise irrigation data can help with monitoring water usage and optimizing agricultural yield, particularly in developing countries. Irrigation data, in tandem with precipitation data, can be used to predict water budgets as well as climate and weather modeling. With our research, we produce an irrigation prediction model that combines unsupervised clustering of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) temporal signatures with a precipitation heuristic to label the months that irrigation peaks for each cropland cluster in a given year. We have developed a novel irrigation model and Python package ("Irrigation30") to generate 30m resolution irrigation predictions of cropland worldwide. With a small crowdsourced test set of cropland coordinates and irrigation labels, using a fraction of the resources used by the state-of-the-art NASA-funded GFSAD30 project with irrigation data limited to India and Australia, our model was able to achieve consistency scores in excess of 97\% and an accuracy of 92\% in a small geo-diverse randomly sampled test set.

AB  - Vegetable growers in Europe are continually under increasing pressure to optimize irrigation and nutrient management. This results from the widespread effects of climate change and of competition from other sectors for water, and increasing societal pressure to reduce nutrient contamination of water bodies. The widespread and growing adoption of drip irrigation and fertigation provides vegetable growers with the technical infrastructure for greatly improved irrigation and nutrient management. However, quantitative decisions to achieve optimal irrigation and nutrient management, and increasingly of the two together, require complex decision-making. Numerous factors regarding climate, soil characteristics, field infrastructure, and crop characteristics need to be considered. Decision Support Systems (DSSs) and simulation models are tools that process large and diverse amounts of information to provide irrigation and nutrient recommendations that are specific to individual crops and sites. Commonly, DSSs incorporate simulation models, which enables site and crop specific assessment, and the possibility for dynamic responses to fluctuations in climate etc. There is an on-going trend for web-based DSSs that can access on-line data bases such as of climate and soil data, and that users consult with smartphone Apps. This article firstly reviews several general aspects regarding the use of DSSs/models in commercial vegetable production, such as how to enhance their user-friendliness. Subsequently, it describes DSSs/models that have been developed or are being used to assist with irrigation or nutrient management, or both, of vegetable crops. The most relevant aspects of these DSSs/models are highlighted. In addition to DSSs/models for practical on-farm management, the use of DSSs/models for scenario analysis to demonstrate theoretical case studies to policy makers, growers and advisors is discussed. A focus throughout is on how to make these products attractive and effective to potential users. The geographical focus is on Europe; however, particularly relevant cases from elsewhere are also considered. With the current state of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), and considering the inevitable future developments, DSSs can provide vegetable growers with effective and user-friendly tools to assist them to optimize irrigation and nutrient management.

AB  - Irrigation is an important adaptation strategy to cope with climate change which reduces vulnerability to water stress and improves crop productivity to feed millions. There is evidence of crop yield stagnation in many developing countries, and irrigation efficiency is claimed to increase crop productivity. Therefore, this paper uses data envelopment analysis to evaluate the farmer's productivity through technical efficiency (TE), i.e., the relationship between resource inputs and outputs of 513 paddy farmers in Eastern India. The results show that the farms are, on average operating at 14% TE, leaving a considerable scope to improve up to 86% to reach the optimal level. A significant difference is observed between irrigated and rain-fed paddy farmers, such that10% of the irrigated farms achieved efficiency scores over 40% and only 2% of rain-fed farms achieved the same. The tobit and beta fit regression models are estimated to find out the factors that influence the TE. Both surface water and groundwater sources of irrigation are used as predictors, along with other socio-demographic factors. Access to surface water irrigation is identified to be a significant determinant of farm efficiency, however, surface water irrigation, such as canal irrigation, is accessible only to farmers living on plain land. Farmers living on highlands need to explore other sources of irrigation practices, such as drip and sprinkler, that can increase TE and farm productivity. Therefore, this paper calls for government intervention to provide extensive training and facilities for these micro-irrigation practices.

AB  - In recent years, deep learning algorithms have been successfully applied in the development of decision support systems in various aspects of agriculture, such as yield estimation, crop diseases, weed detection, etc. Agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater. Due to challenges such as lack of natural resources and climate change, an efficient decision support system for irrigation is crucial. Evapotranspiration and soil water content are the most critical factors in irrigation scheduling. In this paper, the ability of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) to model daily reference evapotranspiration and soil water content is investigated. The application of these techniques to predict these parameters was tested for three sites in Portugal. A single-layer BLSTM with 512 nodes was selected. Bayesian optimization was used to determine the hyperparameters, such as learning rate, decay, batch size, and dropout size.The model achieved the values of mean square error values within the range of 0.014 to 0.056 and R2 ranging from 0.96 to 0.98. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was added to the LSTM to investigate potential performance improvement. Performance dropped in all datasets due to the complexity of the model. The performance of the models was also compared with CNN, traditional machine learning algorithms Support Vector Regression, and Random Forest. LSTM achieved the best performance. Finally, the impact of the loss function on the performance of the proposed models was investigated. The model with the mean square error as loss function performed better than the model with other loss functions.

AB  - Farming is considered the biggest factor in strengthening the economy of any country. It also has significant effects on GDP growth. However, due to a lack of information and consultation, farmers suffer from significant crop losses every year. Typically, farmers consult agricultural officers for detecting crop diseases. However, the accuracy of predictions made by agricultural officers based on their experience is not always reliable. If the exact issues are not identified at right time then it results in a heavy crop loss. To address this issue, Computational Intelligence, also known as Machine Learning, can be applied based on historical data. In this study, an intelligent crop yield prediction algorithm is developed using various types of regression-based algorithms. The Crop Yield Prediction Dataset from the Kaggle repository is used for model training and evaluation. Among all different regression methods Random Forest has shown the better performance in terms of R2 score and other errors.

AB  - Rice yield is essential for more than half of the world's population, and thus, accurate predictions of rice yield are of great importance for trade, development policies, humanitarian assistance, decision-makers, etc. However, traditional mechanistic models and statistical machine learning models need to identify features, making the research on and application of these models laborious and time-consuming. In this paper, a novel end-to-end prediction model that fuses two back-propagation neural networks (BPNNs) with an independently recurrent neural network (IndRNN), named BBI-model, is proposed to address these challenges. In stage one, BBI-model preprocesses the original area and meteorology data. In stage two, one BPNN and the IndRNN are used to learn deep spatial and temporal features in parallel. In stage three, another BPNN combines two kinds of deep features and learns the relationships between these deep features and rice yields to make predictions for summer and winter rice yields. The experimental results indicate that BBI-model achieved the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) for the summer rice prediction (0.0044 and 0.0057, respectively) and corresponding values of 0.0074 and 0.0192 for the winter rice prediction when the number of layers in the network was set to six. Moreover, the errors of the model using the combination of deep spatial-temporal features were significantly lower than when simply using deep temporal features. Furthermore, the model converged quickly with 100 iterations and then remained stable. These findings confirm that the model can make accurate predictions for summer and winter rice yields of 81 counties in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.

AB  - Agriculture plays a significant role in the economic sector. The automation in agriculture is the main concern and the emerging subject across the world. The population is increasing tremendously and with this increase the demand of food and employment is also increasing. The traditional methods which were used by the farmers, were not sufficient enough to fulfill these requirements. Thus, new automated methods were introduced. These new methods satisfied the food requirements and also provided employment opportunities to billions of people. Artificial Intelligence in agriculture has brought an agriculture revolution. This technology has protected the crop yield from various factors like the climate changes, population growth, employment issues and the food security problems. This main concern of this paper is to audit the various applications of Artificial intelligence in agriculture such as for irrigation, weeding, spraying with the help of sensors and other means embedded in robots and drones. These technologies saves the excess use of water, pesticides, herbicides, maintains the fertility of the soil, also helps in the efficient use of man power and elevate the productivity and improve the quality. This paper surveys the work of many researchers to get a brief overview about the current implementation of automation in agriculture, the weeding systems through the robots and drones. The various soil water sensing methods are discussed along with two automated weeding techniques. The implementation of drones is discussed, the various methods used by drones for spraying and crop-monitoring is also discussed in this paper.

AB  - Rice is one of the world’s most popular food crops. Since its production is dependent on intensive water use, water management is critical to ensure sustainability of water resource. However, very limited data is available on water use in rice irrigation. In the present study, traditional machine learning methods have been used to predict the irrigation schedule of rice daily. The data of year 2013-2015 is used to train the models and to further optimise it. The data of 2016-2017 is used for testing the models. Correlation thresholds are used for feature selection which helps in reducing the number of input parameters from the initial 26 to final 11. The models estimated the crop water demand as a function of weather parameters. Results show that Adaboost performed consistently well with an average accuracy of 71% as compared to other models for predicting the irrigation schedule.

AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE) is defined as the amount of carbon assimilated as biomass or grain produced per unit of water used by the crop. One of the primary questions being asked is how plants will respond to a changing climate with changes in temperature, precipitation, and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) that affect their WUE At the leaf level, increasing CO 2 increases WUE until the leaf is exposed to temperatures exceeded the optimum for growth (i.e., heat stress) and then WUE begins to decline. Leaves subjected to water deficits (i.e., drought stress) show varying responses in WUE. The response of WUE at the leaf level is directly related to the physiological processes controlling the gradients of CO 2 and H 2 O, e.g., leaf:air vapor pressure deficits, between the leaf and air surrounding the leaf. There a variety of methods available to screen genetic material for enhanced WUE under scenarios of climate change. When we extend from the leaf to the canopy, then the dynamics of crop water use and biomass accumulation have to consider soil water evaporation rate, transpiration from the leaves, and the growth pattern of the crop. Enhancing WUE at the canopy level can be achieved by adopting practices that reduce the soil water evaporation component and divert more water into transpiration which can be through crop residue management, mulching, row spacing, and irrigation. Climate change will affect plant growth, but we have opportunities to enhance WUE through crop selection and cultural practices to offset the impact of a changing climate.

AB  - The energy demand and their associated costs in pressurized irrigation networks together with water scarcity are currently causing serious challenges for irrigation district's (ID) managers. Additionally, most of the new water distribution networks in IDs have been designed to be operated on-demand complexing ID managers the daily decision-making process. The knowledge of the water demand several days in advance would facilitate the management of the system and would help to optimize the water use and energy costs. For an efficient management and optimization of the water-energy nexus in IDs, longer term forecasting models are needed. In this work, a new hybrid model (called LSTMHybrid) combining Fuzzy Logic (FL), Genetic Algorithm (GA), LSTM encoder-decoder and dense or full connected neural networks (DNN) for the one-week forecasting of irrigation water demand at ID scale has been developed. LSTMHybrid was developed in Python and applied to a real ID. The optimal input variables for LSTMHydrid were mean temperature (°C), reference evapotranspiration (mm), solar radiation (MJ m−2) and irrigation water demand of the ID (m3) from 1 to 7 days prior to the first day of prediction. The optimal LSTMHybrid model selected consisted of 50 LSTM cells in the encoder submodel, 409 LSTM cells in the decoder submodel and three hidden layers in the DNN submodel with 31, 96 and 128 neurons in each hidden layer, respectively. Thus, LSTMHybrid had a total of 1.5 million parameters, obtaining a representativeness higher than 94 % and an accuracy around of 20 %.

AB  - Irrigation schedules on traditional irrigation controllers tend to disperse too much water by design and cause runoff, which results in wastage of water and pollution of water sources. Previous attempts at tackling this problem either used expensive sensors or ignored site-specific factors. In this paper, we propose Weather-aware Runoff Prevention Irrigation Control (WaRPIC), a low-cost, practical solution that optimally applies water, while preventing runoff for each sprinkler zone. WaRPIC involves homeowner-assisted data collection on the landscape. The gathered data is used to build site-specific machine learning models that can accurately predict the Maximum Allowable Runtime (MAR) for each sprinkler zone given weather data obtained from the nearest weather station. We have also developed a low-cost module that can retrofit irrigation controllers in order to modify its irrigation schedule. We built a neural network-based model that predicts the MAR for any set of antecedent conditions. The model's prediction is compared with a state-of-the-art irrigation controller and the volume of water wasted by WaRPIC is only 2.6% of that of the state-of-the-art. We have deployed our modules at residences and estimate that the average homeowner can save 38,826 gallons of water over the course of May-Oct 2019, resulting in savings of $192.

AB  - Microorganisms are pervasive and have a significant impact in various fields such as healthcare, environmental monitoring, and biotechnology. Accurate classification and identification of microorganisms are crucial for professionals in diverse areas, including clinical microbiology, agriculture, and food production. Traditional methods for analyzing microorganisms, like culture techniques and manual microscopy, can be labor-intensive, expensive, and occasionally inadequate due to morphological similarities between different species. As a result, there is an increasing need for intelligent image recognition systems to automate microorganism classification procedures with minimal human involvement. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of ML and DL perspectives used for the precise recognition and classification of microorganism images, utilizing a dataset comprising eight distinct microorganism types: Spherical bacteria, Amoeba, Hydra, Paramecium, Rod bacteria, Spiral bacteria, Euglena and Yeast. We employed several ml algorithms including SVM, Random Forest, and KNN, as well as the deep learning algorithm CNN. Among these methods, the highest accuracy was achieved using the CNN approach. We delve into current techniques, challenges, and advancements, highlighting opportunities for further progress.

AB  - The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization asserts that the whole world's population would rise by an additional 2 billion in 2050, whereas at that time, the increased land area for farming will solely account for 4%. In the aforementioned situation, more coherent cultivation practices need to be accomplished by utilizing modern technological advancements and unravel the ongoing barriers in farming. An undeviating use of Artificial Intelligence and its subsets in agriculture can serve to be an embodiment of a shift in the way that farming is exercised during the present time. The agricultural domain faces countless obstacles for instance disease, improper soil analysis, pest infestation, irrigation, and inadequate drainage, and a lot more. These challenges lead to dangerous environmental hazards and intense crop loss as a result of using redundant chemicals. The realm of Artificial Intelligence along with its meticulous learning abilities has evolved to form a key approach for dealing with diverse farming-related issues. This paper emphasizes the applications of Artificial Intelligence practices in different domains of agricultural science, the industry insights, and the challenges to adopting AI in agriculture.

AB  - Agriculture automation is the main concern and emerging subject for every country. The world population is increasing at a very fast rate and with increase in population the need for food increases briskly. Traditional methods used by farmers aren't sufficient enough to serve the increasing demand and so they have to hamper the soil by using harmful pesticides in an intensified manner. This affects the agricultural practice a lot and in the end the land remains barren with no fertility. This paper talks about different automation practices like IOT, Wireless Communications, Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence, Deep learning. There are some areas which are causing the problems to agriculture field like crop diseases, lack of storage management, pesticide control, weed management, lack of irrigation and water management and all this problems can be solved by above mentioned different techniques. Today, there is an urgent need to decipher the issues like use of harmful pesticides, controlled irrigation, control on pollution and effects of environment in agricultural practice. Automation of farming practices has proved to increase the gain from the soil and also has strengthened the soil fertility. This paper surveys the work of many researchers to get a brief overview about the current implementation of automation in agriculture. The paper also discusses a proposed system which can be implemented in botanical farm for flower and leaf identification and watering using IOT.

AB  - Agriculture is the backbone of all developing countries. The livelihood of a huge majority of the Indian population is completely dependent on agriculture. However lack of basic requirement lead to poor development in this sector. The major factor required for the development of this sector is to improve water supply level. The lack of proper monsoon has resulted in poor agricultural yield. Based on the natural calamities we can predict the requirement of water for particular crop at different stages of growth and also enhance the yield. In this paper, we have chosen Thottiyam taluk as example located in the state of Tamilnadu, India. For that location we have collected the basic attributes required for good irrigation management for the months of December and January. Artificial Intelligence techniques are applied to predict the water level requirement and their performances can be compared.

AB  - Characterizing soil moisture (SM) around drip irrigation pipes is crucial for precise and optimized farming. Machine learning (ML) approaches are particularly suitable for this task as they can reduce uncertainties caused by soil conditions and the drip pipe positions, using features extracted from relevant datasets. This letter addresses local moisture detection in the vicinity of dripping pipes using a portable microwave imaging system. The employed ML approach is fed with two dimensional images generated by two different microwave imaging techniques based on spatio-temporal measurements at various frequency bands. The study investigates the performance of K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) algorithms for moisture classification based on these images, both before and after performing soil clutter reduction. We also explore the potentials of CNN and KNN for moisture estimation around the plant roots and in the presence of pebbles. The results demonstrate the more accurate moisture estimation using CNN when it is applied after clutter reduction considering back projection algorithm (BPA) as the imaging technique.

AB  - This chapter presents different techniques and applications of Artificial Intelligence for yield prediction and smart irrigation. Timely prediction of irrigation requirements and crop yields is necessary for farmer’s welfare and satisfaction. The beforehand prediction significantly contributes to minimizing production cost and maximizing crop yields. The precise prediction of crops’ yields is also useful for government, as it is effective in planning various schemes, transport needs, buying mechanisms, storage infrastructure, and liquid position of the economy before actual selling of crop by farmers to market. This chapter acknowledges the past breakthroughs and emerging Artificial Intelligence-based techniques in precision farming specifically for yield prediction and smart irrigation. Artificial Intelligence-based system provides sufficient information about crop yields at an early stage and its associated smart irrigation management system is effective in the judicious use of essential resources such as water and energy for agriculture.

AB  - Real-time monitoring of soil matric potential has now become a common practice for precision irrigation management. Some crops, such as cranberries, are susceptible to both water and anoxic stresses. Excessive variations in soil matric potential in the root zone may reduce plant transpiration, due to either saturated or dry soil conditions, thereby reducing productivity. A timely supply of the right amount of water is, therefore, fundamental for efficient irrigation management. In this paper, we compare the capabilities of a machine learning-based model and a physics-based model to predict soil matric potential in the root zone. The machine learning model is a random forest algorithm, while the physics-based model is a two-dimensional solver of Richards equation (HYDRUS 2D). After training and calibration on a dataset collected in a cranberry field located in Québec (Canada), the performance of the two models is evaluated for 30 different time frames of 72-h soil matric potential forecasts. The results highlight that both models can accurately forecast the soil matric potential in the root zone. The machine learning-based model can achieve better performance when compared to the physics-based model, but forecasting accuracy decreases rapidly toward the end of the 72-h lead time, while the error for the Richards equation-based model does not increase with time and remain small compared to the typical measurement error.

AB  - Recent increase in green-roof installation has increased irrigation water consumption which could be wasteful using conventional watering management protocol. The knowledge gap in irrigation optimization to achieve water conservation could be filled. The complicated conventional approach uses weather and soil sensors to calculate watering needs, which is impractical and not cost-effective. This study employs artificial intelligence algorithms composed of artificial neural network and fuzzy logic, using weather data to simulate soil moisture changes to develop an optimal irrigation strategy. The artificial neural network is trained to predict soil moisture based on four daily weather variables: real-time air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed. Fuzzy-neural network is applied to determine the irrigation time and watering volume. The simulation model successfully mimics the human brain in making irrigation decision. The artificial intelligence irrigation could maintain adequate soil moisture ranging from 0.13 to 0.22 m3/m3 and reduce 20% of water use with improved plant coverage. Since the evapotranspiration from living vegetation plays a key role in the passive cooling mechanism, better plant coverage could increase the thermal-energy performance of green roofs. The low-cost and effective technique can motivate the adoption of green roofs by alleviating the water consumption obstacle.

AB  - Predicting precipitation in the tropics has been challenging due to the complex atmospheric dynamics, high humidity, and frequent occurrences of convective rainfall. In the Indian context, the difficulty is further exacerbated because of the monsoon intra-seasonal oscillations which introduce significant variability in rainfall patterns over short periods. Earlier investigations into rainfall prediction leveraged numerical weather prediction methods, along with statistical and deep learning approaches. This study introduces a nuanced approach by deploying a deep-learning spatial model aimed to enhancing rainfall prediction accuracy on a finer scale. In this study, we hypothesise that integrating physical understanding improves the precipitation prediction skill of deep learning models with high precision for finer spatial scales, such as cities. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a physics-informed ConvLSTM2D model to predict 6hr and 12hr ahead precipitation for the coastal city of Mumbai in India. We use the ERA-5 reanalysis data at hourly timesteps from 2011-2022 for the selection of predictor variables, such as temperature, potential vorticity and humidity corresponding to different geopotential levels. The ConvLSTM2D model was trained to the target variable precipitation for 4 different grids representing different spatial grid locations of Mumbai. The NSE metric, utilized to evaluate the precision of 6 and 12 hours ahead precipitation forecasts, yielded ranges of 0.49 to 0.66 for 6-hour predictions and 0.53 to 0.69 for 12-hour predictions during the training phase. In the testing phase, the NSE values ranged from 0.41 to 0.59 for 6-hour forecasts and from 0.41 to 0.61 for 12-hour forecasts, respectively. These values highlight the model's high accuracy and its capacity to capture variations. Thus, the use of the ConvLSTM2D model for rainfall prediction, utilizing physics-informed data from specific grids with limited spatial information, reflects current advancements in meteorological research that emphasize both efficiency and localized precision.

AB  - Rice growth rate prediction is crucial to achieve precision agriculture. In this study, growth data from three different rice cultivars at two different climate regions in Taiwan were used to calculate the rice growth rate (Gr) in key growth stages. A total of 10,246 Gr data from 95 cultivations were used to assess the feasibility of simulating rice growth rate from ambient temperature by regression algorithm (REG), artificial neural networks (ANN) and gene-expression programming (GEP). Simulation was carried out for each algorithm using ambient temperature and growing season as input variables for the entire life cycle of rice (Trall) either as one continuous growth period or as the sum of four distinctive growth stages (Tr1~4). The results showed that the model output from Tr1~4 are more accurate than Trall. However, simulation errors in the transitional stages occurred when the growth rate at different stages was modelled separately. Artificial intelligence based nonlinear models were more accurate than the regression model and ANN generally exhibited better performance than other two models. Compared with REG, the root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of averaged error-in-days for the whole growth period decreased by 41.38% and 42.81% in ANN and 30.14%, and 31.21% in GEP. Considering the potential errors in the transition stages and the high hardware demand for ANN, the GEP-Trall model is recommended for the rice growth rate modeling.

AB  -  Agricultural irrigation is a significant contributor to freshwater consumption. However, the current irrigation systems used in the field are not efficient. They rely mainly on soil moisture sensors and the experience of growers, but do not account for future soil moisture loss. Predicting soil moisture loss is challenging because it is influenced by numerous factors, including soil texture, weather conditions, and plant characteristics. This paper proposes a solution to improve irrigation efficiency, which is called DRLIC . DRLIC is a sophisticated irrigation system that uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize its performance. The system employs a neural network, known as the DRL control agent, which learns an optimal control policy that considers both the current soil moisture measurement and the future soil moisture loss. We introduce an irrigation reward function that enables our control agent to learn from previous experiences. However, there may be instances where the output of our DRL control agent is unsafe, such as irrigating too much or too little water. To avoid damaging the health of the plants, we implement a safety mechanism that employs a soil moisture predictor to estimate the performance of each action. If the predicted outcome is deemed unsafe, we perform a relatively conservative action instead. To demonstrate the real-world application of our approach, we develop an irrigation system that comprises sprinklers, sensing and control nodes, and a wireless network. We evaluate the performance of DRLIC by deploying it in a testbed consisting of six almond trees. During a 15-day in-field experiment, we compare the water consumption of DRLIC with a widely-used irrigation scheme. Our results indicate that DRLIC outperforms the traditional irrigation method by achieving water savings of up to 9.52%.

AB  - Irrigation water demand is highly variable and depends on farmer behaviour, which affects the performance of irrigation networks. The irrigation depth applied to each farm also depends on farmer behaviour and is affected by precise and imprecise variables. In this work, a hybrid methodology combining artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms was developed to model farmer behaviour and forecast the daily irrigation depth used by each farmer. The models were tested in a real irrigation district located in southwest Spain. Three optimal models for the main crops in the irrigation district were obtained. The representability (R2) and accuracy of the predictions (standard error prediction, SEP) were 0.72, 0.87 and 0.72; and 22.20%, 9.80% and 23.42%, for rice, maize and tomato crop models, respectively.

AB  - Agriculture consumes an important ratio of the water reserve in irrigated areas. The improvement of irrigation is becoming essential to reduce this high water consumption by adapting supplies to the crop needs and avoiding losses. This global issue has prompted many scientists to reflect on sustainable solutions using innovative technologies, namely Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), Machine Learning (ML), and the Internet of Things (IoT). This article aims to present an overview of the use of these new technologies in the analysis of the water status of crops for better irrigation management, with an emphasis on arboriculture. The review demonstrated the importance of UAV-ML-IoT technologies. This contribution is due to the relevant information that can be collected from IoT sensors and extracted from UAV images through various sensors (RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, thermal), and the ability of ML models to monitor and predict water status. The review in this paper is organized into four main sections: the use of UAV in arboriculture, UAV for irrigation management in arboriculture, IoT systems and irrigation management, and ML for data processing and decision-making. A discussion is presented regarding the prospects for smart irrigation using geospatial technologies and machine learning.

AB  - Rapid improvements in deep learning (DL) techniques have made it possible to detect and recognize objects from images. DL approaches have recently entered various agricultural and farming applications after being successfully employed in various fields. Automatic identification of plant diseases can help farmers manage their crops more effectively, resulting in higher yields. Detecting plant disease in crops using images is an intrinsically difficult task. In addition to their detection, individual species identification is necessary for applying tailored control methods. A survey of research initiatives that use convolutional neural networks (CNN), a type of DL, to address various plant disease detection concerns was undertaken in the current publication. In this work, we have reviewed 100 of the most relevant CNN articles on detecting various plant leaf diseases over the last five years. In addition, we identified and summarized several problems and solutions corresponding to the CNN used in plant leaf disease detection. Moreover, Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) trained on image data were the most effective method for detecting early disease detection. We expressed the benefits and drawbacks of utilizing CNN in agriculture, and we discussed the direction of future developments in plant disease detection.

AB  - Irrigation decision-making has evolved from solely depending on farmers’ decisions taken based on the visual analysis of field conditions to making decisions based on crop water need predictions generated using machine learning (ML) techniques. This paper reviews ML related articles to discuss how ML has been used to enhance irrigation decision making. We reviewed 16 studies that used ML approaches for irrigation scheduling prediction and decision-making focusing on the input features, algorithms used and their applicability in real world conditions. ML performances in terms of accuracy, water conservation compared to fixed or threshold-based methods are discussed along with modeling performances. Informed by the 16 research studies, we assessed constraints to the adoption of ML in irrigation decision making at field scale, which include limited data availability coupled with data sharing constraints, and a lack of uncertainty quantification as well as the need for physics informed ML based irrigation scheduling models. To address these limitations, we discussed approaches in future research such as integrating process-based models with ML, incorporating expert knowledge into the modeling procedure, and making data and tools Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). These approaches will improve ML modeling outcomes and boost the availability of farm-related data and tools for FAIRer data-driven applications of irrigation modeling.

AB  - In the current age of high competition and risk in markets, technological advancements are a must for better growth and sustainability. The same applies to the agriculture industry. Every farmer has high stakes on the crops, their yield and quality. Rising water issues and need for proper methodologies for farm maintenance is a hot issue that needs to be tackled at utmost propriety. An automation of irrigation systems in farms is proposed in this research. The proposed solution is based on the Internet of Things (IoT), which would be a cheaper and more precise solution to the farm needs. A Monitoring system whose main purpose is to solve the over irrigation, soil erosion and crop-specific irrigation problem will be developed to ease and efficiently manage Irrigation problems. Since it is a well-known fact that the water is a scarce resource and over wastage of such an essential resource should be minimized. The proposed solution will be developed by establishing a distributed wireless sensor network (WSN), wherein each region of the farm would be covered by various sensor modules which will be transmitting data on a common server. Machine learning (ML) algorithms will support predictions for irrigation patterns based on crops and weather scenarios. So, a sustainable approach to irrigation is provided in this paper.

AB  - To promote the efficient use of water resources and the sustainable development of the agricultural economy, the main evaluation index that links economic production and the effective use of water resources, irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE), is scientifically evaluated and analyzed. To obtain accurate evaluation results, an evaluation model for IWUE based on an extreme learning machine (ELM) model optimized by the spider monkey optimization (SMO) algorithm (i.e., the SMO-ELM model) was proposed. The model was applied to the evaluation and analysis of IWUE in 24 large and medium irrigation districts in Heilongjiang Province. On this basis, the main driving factors of IWUE differentiation in the irrigation districts were identified, and adaptive control strategies were explored. In addition, to thoroughly test the performance of the constructed SMO-ELM evaluation model, a comparative analysis was performed for a BP model, an ELM model, an ELM model with crow search algorithm optimization (CSA-ELM) and the SMO-ELM model. The results show that there are regional differences in the IWUE of the irrigation districts and that the IWUE of the districts in the eastern part of the study area is better than that of the districts in the central and western parts. The irrigation districts with relatively high evaluation grades (IV to V) are distributed mostly in the eastern part of the study area, and most of the irrigation districts with low evaluation grades (I to II) are located near the main branch of the Songhuajiang River. Differences in indexes, such as the soak field quota and proportion of rice sowing area, are the most important factors related to variations in IWUE grades among the irrigation districts, and targeted control strategies such as planting structure optimization are proposed. The rationality and superiority of the SMO-ELM model are verified by comparing the coefficient of determination (R2), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and accuracy of classification (accuracy) of the BP, ELM, CSA-ELM and SMO-ELM models. The R2, MSE, MAPE, and accuracy of the SMO-ELM model are 0.9999, 4.33 × 10−10, 0.00039, and 99.8%, respectively, which are much better than those of the other models. The results of complexity analysis verify the stability of the IWUE evaluation results for the irrigation districts. This article provides a new model for the evaluation of IWUE and scientific and technological support for ensuring the safety of water resources and maintaining the sustainable green development of agriculture.

AB  - Wheat plays a crucial role in Morocco's food security, economic stability, and livelihoods of farming communities. Assessing key vegetation indices (as yield predictors), along with understanding potential yield, yield gap, and major determinants for this gap at regional and national scales, is vital for improving food security with resilience in variable climatic conditions. Analysing the yield gap and its causes during drought and optimal weather conditions can reduce crop failure risks and enhance productivity specially in variable rainfed production systems. This study aimed to develop scalable methodology to predict field- and landscape-level yield and yield gaps for wheat and their underlying causes examplifying Morocco's rainfed production environment combining remote sensing, machine learning, and ground information. By analysing six vegetation indices (EVI2, CGVI, MSR, NDVI, OSAVI, and RVI) derived from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery (10 m resolution) over three successive growing seasons (2018–2019, 2019–2020, and 2020–2021), the study employed advanced vegetation index models for accurate prediction of wheat yields and yield gaps at plot and on a larger regional scale within the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region. To identify the determinants of yield gap, climate and soil datasets were merged with crop management information and the random forest model was fine-tuned and assessed for each season and cumulatively. The findings highlighted that RVI, GCVI, and NDVI vegetation indices were particularly effective in predicting wheat yields, showing the highest R2 and the lowest prediction errors (RMSE). Such predictive methodologies are crucial for policymakers to proactively plan and mitigate risk minimization and adaption plans at regional and national levels. The models predicted rainfed potential yields of 5.99, 1.53, and 4.66 t ha−1, with corresponding yield gap of 3.38, 0.73, and 1.58 t ha−1 for the seasons of 2018/2019 (favorable); 2019/2020 (drought) and 2020/2021 (favorable), respectively. Across three periods, critical factors determining yield include soil moisture, total rainfall during the crop growing period, evapotranspiration, and soil texture and carbon content. To minimize drought risks and maximize benefits during variable rainfall conditions, it is essential to implement pre-season drought forecasts, customize seeding dates based on soil moisture, adopt technologies that enhance soil moisture retention, and utilize climate-adapted farming practices in the semi-arid and arid rainfed regions.

AB  - The rise of the Internet of Things allowed higher spatial–temporal resolution soil moisture data captured through in situ sensing. Such abundance of data enables machine learning-based soil moisture forecast as an alternative to traditional mechanistic approaches for irrigation water need estimation. This paper develops a guideline for soil moisture forecast modeling based on machine learning, tested in a real case analysis comprehending eight crop types in twelve fields from four farms distributed over diverse climatic scenarios in Brazil. Instead of a single value, we predict the following days' minimum and maximum values as targets to monitor risks of extreme soil moisture values. Furthermore, modeling soil moisture directly in volumetric water content (VWC) is better than modeling soil matric potential (SMP) to later convert in soil moisture VWC. We test several algorithms and find out that LightGBM outperforms linear regression, decision tree, random forest, multilayer perceptron, LSTM, and StemGNN. Also, blending predictions via algorithm ensemble provides an additional accuracy gain. For model training and accuracy measurement, we use weighted datasets to privilege rare but critical data points. We show that soil moisture forecast reaches its maximum performance considering only past soil moisture, a context-aware index, and a precipitation forecast. Finally, we demonstrate that traditional domain-knowledge features - such as evapotranspiration, crop phenology, and soil hydraulic behavior - are not relevant to improving SM forecast performance. Consequently, our paper suggests full data-driven approaches for irrigation water need estimation, observed some care regarding data quality.

AB  - Irrigation efficiency projects aim to conserve water for in-stream flow and agricultural use by reducing water losses throughout the system. Piping irrigation canals is a common irrigation efficiency method that results in trade-offs: while it increases efficiency of irrigation water conveyance, it reduces incidental groundwater recharge. This paper focuses on the data and decision-making of canal piping, focusing primarily on understanding the potential impacts of reduced canal leakage on shallow wells. By conducting a spatial analysis of shallow wells in the basin at risk of being impacted by canal piping, and combining this with interviews with water managers in central Oregon's Upper Deschutes Basin, we demonstrate the complex socio-natural dynamics and politics of water conservation decision-making. The research finds that irrigation canal piping is fully supported by water managers in the study area as a means of physically shifting flows of water towards particular valued uses, yet at the same time there is not enough data to understand the potential impacts of canal piping on water users reliant on canal seepage. Given the lack of localized shallow groundwater monitoring data, water managers are reliant upon basin-scale model predictions when defining the trade-offs in canal piping. Broadly, the research demonstrates that well-intended water management decisions can have trade-offs and impacts that are not well understood, pointing to the need for more groundwater monitoring and critical attention to the multiple scales of irrigation efficiency to inform the co-management of surface water and groundwater for the many water users within a basin.

AB  - Determination of wetting patterns’ dimensions is essential in designing and managing surface/subsurface drip irrigation systems. The laboratory experiments were conducted using physical model with dimensions of 3 × 1 × 0.5 m3 to evaluate the moisture redistribution process under continuous and pulse surface/subsurface irrigation systems. In the present study, the efficiency of a new machine learning method, named fuzzy c-means clustering- based adaptive neural-fuzzy inference system combined with a new meta-heuristic algorithm, hybrid particle swarm optimization – gravity search algorithm (ANFIS-FCM-PSOGSA), is investigated in order to model wetting front redistribution of drip irrigation systems (IS) using soil and system parameters as inputs under continuous and pulse surface/subsurface IS. The outcomes of the assessed method are compared with those of the ANFIS-FCM-PSO, generalized regression neural networks and multivariate adaptive regression splines. In assessing the implemented methods, four commonly used indices, root mean square errors (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) and graphical methods (e.g., scatter, box plot and Taylor diagrams) are utilized. The benchmark outcomes demonstrate the superiority of new method in estimating wetting front dimensions by improving the accuracy of the ANFIS-FCM-PSO by 29.6%, 18.5%, 6.1%, and 9.0% in estimating the diameter of horizontal redistribution with respect to RMSE, MAE, R2 and NSE, respectively. Furthermore, the ANFIS-FCM-PSOGSA respectively improves the RMSE, MAE, R2 and NSE accuracy of the ANFIS-FCM-PSO by 20.1%, 19.2%, 35.7% and 35.6% in estimating the diameter of downward vertical redistribution. The general outcomes recommend the use of new method in estimating wetting front dimensions of drip irrigation systems.

AB  - Water management system and energy optimization are most important for today's agriculture. Precision irrigation manages the water utilization and reduces the utilization of energy. The irrigation system consists of observation system, storing, processing and it helps in decision making as well. Internet of Things (IoT) components is used to observe the various information's, such as soil moisture, soil temperature, weather conditions, and environmental conditions from the fields. With the help of various information, the proposed work optimizes the requirements and thus reduces energy. The cloud environment is used to store the observed parameters from the IoT components. The machine learning algorithm is useful in taking the process of data, from the cloud environments, and do forecasting on the irrigation system. In this work, proposed a hybrid model for irrigation system and do the decision making using, different observation of parameters. This work consists of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting-based Tree (GBT), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Spearman's rank correlation. The KNN is used to gather the nearest sensing information, with the help of various parameters. The GBT is used to predict the real values based on the observations. The LSTM is used to predict, time series prediction using different observations of the surrounding. The Spearman's rank correlation is used to receive the correlated values of real, and time series prediction. Using the GBT, LSTM and spearman rank correlation, the consolidated time series forecasting values are predicted in irrigation. The implementation of proposed work is done with the help of banana species in the time period, between Feb 2020, Dec 2020 and 2021. The duration of the cultivation, minimum and maximum water requirements and other supporting parameters are calculated using various sensors. The real and time series water requirements are calculated in the time interval of 12, 24, 36 and 48 etc. With the help of this time series data, month-wise prediction is performed. The implementations were performed in single and group of banana tree water requirements. After implementation of proposed work, for single banana tree 31.4 % of the water requirement has been optimized in 2020 time period. Due to this optimized irrigation, heavy usage of fresh water usage and energy wastage is also reduced.

AB  - Study region: The study area was Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, eastern China. Study focus: Blue-green water utility assessment in crop cultivation is profound to better sustainability of regional resources, agriculture and ecosystems. The aim of current study is to establish a blue-green water differentiation and efficiency evaluation methods for paddy fields, based on daily water migration observation under four irrigation-drainage protocols. The blue-green water use performance under different irrigation-drainage protocols and precipitation patterns in paddy fields and the advantage of the water resources analysis model proposed in the current study were analyzed and discussed. New hydrological insights for the region: The green and blue water efficiency indices (GWE and BWE) were significantly affected by precipitation. GWE (0.495) was 35.1% higher in dry years than in wet years, and BWE was mainly affected by precipitation distribution during the crop growth season. The green and blue water productivity indices (GWP and BWP) showed pronounced differences among various irrigation-drainage measures, and the controlled irrigation (COI) performs the best. BWE and GWP obtained by previous method were 48.9% and 38.9% greater than those reported here, showing that the neglect of interactive blue-green water migration process would overestimate the field irrigation efficiency. The methods employed and results obtained in the present study suggest that it is important to assess the water footprint and blue-green performance for crop cultivation systems.

Forecasting soil moisture is essential to schedule the irrigation and optimize the use of water. Physics based soil moisture models need rich features and heavy computation which is not scalable. In recent literature, conventional machine learning models have been applied for this problem. These models are fast and simple, but they often fail to capture the spatio-temporal correlation that soil moisture exhibits over a region. In this work, we propose a novel graph neural network based solution that learns temporal graph structures and forecast soil moisture in an end-to-end framework. Our solution is able to handle the problem of missing ground truth soil moisture which is common in practice. We show the merit of our algorithm on real-world soil moisture data.

AB  - Source code summarization involves creating brief descriptions of source code in natural language. These descriptions are a key component of software documentation such as JavaDocs. Automatic code summarization is a prized target of software engineering research, due to the high value summaries have to programmers and the simultaneously high cost of writing and maintaining documentation by hand. Current work is almost all based on machine models trained via big data input. Large datasets of examples of code and summaries of that code are used to train an e.g. encoder-decoder neural model. Then the output predictions of the model are evaluated against a set of reference summaries. The input is code not seen by the model, and the prediction is compared to a reference. The means by which a prediction is compared to a reference is essentially word overlap, calculated via a metric such as BLEU or ROUGE. The problem with using word overlap is that not all words in a sentence have the same importance, and many words have synonyms. The result is that calculated similarity may not match the perceived similarity by human readers. In this paper, we conduct an experiment to measure the degree to which various word overlap metrics correlate to human-rated similarity of predicted and reference summaries. We evaluate alternatives based on current work in semantic similarity metrics and propose recommendations for evaluation of source code summarization.

AB  - Machine learning is an important decision support tool for crop yield prediction, including supporting decisions on what crops to grow and what to do during the growing season of the crops. Several machine learning algorithms have been applied to support crop yield prediction research. In this study, we performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to extract and synthesize the algorithms and features that have been used in crop yield prediction studies. Based on our search criteria, we retrieved 567 relevant studies from six electronic databases, of which we have selected 50 studies for further analysis using inclusion and exclusion criteria. We investigated these selected studies carefully, analyzed the methods and features used, and provided suggestions for further research. According to our analysis, the most used features are temperature, rainfall, and soil type, and the most applied algorithm is Artificial Neural Networks in these models. After this observation based on the analysis of machine learning-based 50 papers, we performed an additional search in electronic databases to identify deep learning-based studies, reached 30 deep learning-based papers, and extracted the applied deep learning algorithms. According to this additional analysis, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is the most widely used deep learning algorithm in these studies, and the other widely used deep learning algorithms are Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN).

AB  - The typical agricultural irrigation scheduler provides information on how much to irrigate and when to irrigate. The accurate and effective scheduler decision for a large agricultural field is still an open research problem. In this work, we address the high dimensionality of the agricultural field and propose a systematic approach to provide optimum irrigation amount and irrigation time for three-dimensional agro-hydrological systems. The water dynamics of the agro-hydrological system are represented using a cylindrical three-dimensional Richards Equation. We introduce a structure-preserving model reduction technique to decrease the dimension of the system model. Using the reduced model, the optimization-based closed-loop scheduler is designed in model predictive control (MPC) environment. The closed-loop approach can handle weather disturbances and provide improved yield and water conservation. The primary objective of the proposed scheduler is to ensure maximum yield, minimum water consumption and maximize the time between the two irrigation events, which results in less electricity usage. The proposed approach is applied to three different scenarios to show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework.

AB  - Traditional irrigation control systems is characterized with inefficient management of water and often results in low water productivity index and reduced cultivation yield. In addition, insufficient water supply and high rate of water loss due to evapotranspiration increases plant stress which often affects its growth and development. Therefore, to address this issues, this paper is aimed at developing a model predictive control (MPC) strategy for water saving drip irrigation experiment that will regulate the soil moisture content within the desired field capacity and above the wilting point, while scheduling irrigation to replace the loss of water from soil and plant due to evapotranspiration in the greenhouse environment. The controller design involves a data driven predictive model identified and integrated with the MPC designer in MATLAB and thereafter exported in Simulink for simulation. The generate controller code was modified and deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4 controller to generate a pulse width modulated signal to drive the pump for the control water mixed with fertilizer. To achieve enhancement of controller an Internet of Things (IoT) integration was used for easy soil, weather, and plant monitoring which are used to update the MPC model for the irrigation control. The performance of the proposed MPC controller deployed drip irrigated Greenhouse(GH1) is benchmarked against an existing automatic evapotranspiration (ETo) model based controller in Greenhouse(GH2), with each greenhouse containing 80 poly bags of Cantaloupe plant with similar growth stage. The results obtained shows that, the proposed MPC-based irrigation system has higher water productivity index of 36.8 g/liters, good quality of fruit with average sweetness level of 13.5 Brix compared to automatic ETo-based irrigation system with 25.6 g/liters and 10.5 Brix, respectively. However, the total mass of harvested fruit for ETo-based irrigation system is higher than MPC-based irrigation system by 21.7%. The performance of the proposed MPC controller was achieved through the integration of event based scheduling with IoT monitoring as well as inclusion of evapotranspiration effect in the plant dynamics.

AB  - The agricultural sector plays an essential role in the economic growth of a country. Specifically, in an Indian context, it is the critical source of livelihood for millions of people living in rural areas. Plant Disease is one of the significant factors affecting the agricultural sector. Plants get infected with diseases for various reasons, including synthetic fertilizers, archaic practices, environmental conditions, etc., which impact the farm yield and subsequently hinder the economy. To address this issue, researchers have explored many applications based on AI and Machine Learning techniques to detect plant diseases. This research survey provides a comprehensive understanding of common plant leaf diseases, evaluates traditional and deep learning techniques for disease detection, and summarizes available datasets. It also explores Explainable AI (XAI) to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models' decisions for end-users. By consolidating this knowledge, the survey offers valuable insights to researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders in the agricultural sector, fostering the development of efficient and transparent solutions for combating plant diseases and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for water to meet the world's growing population. At the same time, increasing drought phenomena reduce water availability. At present, traditional irrigation systems used by farmers allow them to supply the necessary amount of water to crops, but they often result in over-irrigation. The latter over time could lead to a loss of water resources. On the other hand, especially in case of water shortage, inefficient use of water may fail to meet irrigation needs. To remedy this problem, precision irrigation methods are being developed to dose the amount of water needed by crops without wasting both raw material and economics, in order to produce more with less. Specifically, the main technologies used in precision irrigation are IoT-based sensors and machine learning algorithms. In this sense, a data-driven bibliometric review on precision irrigation was conducted from 2001 to 2023; the analysis evidenced 10 main clusters discussed considering the very recent literature after 2020. Among the clusters extracted through CiteSpace are those concerning UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), machine vision, WSN sensors (wireless sensor network) and energy savings. This shows that these topics concerning a new way of seeing precision irrigation, placing greater attention to new technologies and algorithms. The focus is on recent research related to monitoring and advanced control concepts for precision irrigation. It is expected that this revision work will serve as a useful reference to improve the reader's knowledge of advanced monitoring and control opportunities linked to precision irrigation.

AB  - Multispectral and hyperspectral images are increasingly popular in different research fields, such as remote sensing, astronomical imaging, or precision agriculture. However, the amount of free data available to perform machine learning tasks is relatively small. Moreover, artificial intelligence models developed in the area of spectral imaging require input images with a fixed spectral signature, expecting the data to have the same number of spectral bands or the same spectral resolution. This requirement significantly reduces the number of usable sources that can be used for a given model. The scope of this study is to introduce a methodology for spectral image data fusion, in order to allow machine learning models to be trained and/or used on data from a larger number of sources, thus providing better generalization. For this purpose, we propose different interpolation techniques, in order to make multisource spectral data compatible with each other. The interpolation outcomes are evaluated through various approaches. This includes direct assessments using surface plots and metrics such as a Custom Mean Squared Error (CMSE) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Additionally, indirect evaluation is done by estimating their impact on machine learning model training, particularly for semantic segmentation.

Furthermore, this research introduces a vision-based autonomous navigation system that operates through the detected crop row, effectively synchronizing with an autonomous spraying algorithm. This proposed system is characterized by its cost effectiveness that enable the autonomous spraying of herbicides onto detected weeds.

AB  - One of the essential elements in implementing a closed-loop irrigation system is soil moisture estimation based on a limited number of available sensors. One associated problem is the determination of the optimal locations to install the sensors such that good soil moisture estimation can be obtained. In our previous work, the modal degree of observability was employed to address the problem of optimal sensor placement for soil moisture estimation of agro-hydrological systems. It was demonstrated that the optimally placed sensors can improve the soil moisture estimation performance. However, it is unclear whether the optimal sensor placement can significantly improve the soil moisture estimation performance in actual applications. In this work, we investigate the impact of sensor placement in soil moisture estimation for an actual agricultural field in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. In an experiment on the studied field, 42 soil moisture sensors were installed at different depths to collect the soil moisture measurements for one growing season. A three-dimensional agro-hydrological model with heterogeneous soil parameters of the studied field is developed. The modal degree of observability is applied to the three-dimensional system to determine the optimal sensor locations. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is chosen as the data assimilation tool to estimate the soil moisture content of the studied field. Soil moisture estimation results for different scenarios are obtained and analyzed to investigate the effects of sensor placement on the performance of soil moisture estimation in the actual applications.

AB  - Agricultural irrigation is a significant contributor to freshwater consumption. However, the current irrigation systems used in the field are not efficient. They rely mainly on soil moisture sensors and the experience of growers, but do not account for future soil moisture loss. Predicting soil moisture loss is challenging because it is influenced by numerous factors, including soil texture, weather conditions, and plant characteristics. This paper proposes a solution to improve irrigation efficiency, which is called DRLIC. DRLIC is a sophisticated irrigation system that uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize its performance. The system employs a neural network, known as the DRL control agent, which learns an optimal control policy that considers both the current soil moisture measurement and the future soil moisture loss. We introduce an irrigation reward function that enables our control agent to learn from previous experiences. However, there may be instances where the output of our DRL control agent is unsafe, such as irrigating too much or too little water. To avoid damaging the health of the plants, we implement a safety mechanism that employs a soil moisture predictor to estimate the performance of each action. If the predicted outcome is deemed unsafe, we perform a relatively-conservative action instead. To demonstrate the real-world application of our approach, we developed an irrigation system that comprises sprinklers, sensing and control nodes, and a wireless network. We evaluate the performance of DRLIC by deploying it in a testbed consisting of six almond trees. During a 15-day in-field experiment, we compared the water consumption of DRLIC with a widely-used irrigation scheme. Our results indicate that DRLIC outperformed the traditional irrigation method by achieving a water savings of up to 9.52%.

AB  - The accelerated pace of global population growth underscores the crucial role of the agricultural sector in mitigating food scarcity, as well as in supporting livelihoods through employment opportunities and bolstering national economies. This sector faces several critical challenges, including resource depletion, socioeconomic issues, gaps in technology and innovation, and the impact of climate change. The introduction of mechanization has significantly transformed agriculture by enhancing sustainability and increasing the productivity of crops. Recently, traditional farming methods have been supplemented with advanced technologies steering the industry towards precision agriculture. The convergence of these advanced technologies has facilitated the automation of various tasks such as water management, crop monitoring, disease management, and harvesting. The concept of Internet of Everything (IoE) has gained traction due to its holistic approach towards integrating various IoT specializations, called IoXs where X referring to a specific domain. This includes areas like the Internet of Sensors (IoS), Internet of Vehicles (IoV), Internet of Energy (IoEn), Internet of Space Things (IoST), Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and Internet of Drones (IoD). This paper explores the potential of the Internet of Everything (IoE) in revolutionizing agricultural systems. The focus is on assessing the impact of cutting-edge and novel technologies, such as 6G, molecular communication (MC), Internet of Nano Things (IoNT), Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT), Internet of Fungus, and designer phages, in significantly improving agricultural yield, efficiency, and productivity.

AB  - Crop coefficient (Kc) is one of the most significant parameters for crop water demand prediction and irrigation scheduling. However, there is a lack of knowledge about water vapor and Kc in tea plantation ecosystems. This study explored and determined the actual evapotranspiration (ETc) and Kc of two cultivars of tea (Camellia sinensis), clone variety Baiye1 (BY1) and Longjing43 (LJ43), based on lysimeter data. An estimation was made for both for ETc and adjusted ETc, and the corresponding Kc and adjusted Kc. The results showed that the adjusted ETc and Kc values revealed a minor fluctuation when compared to the ETc and Kc values during the experimental period, which indicated that the adjusted ETc and Kc values were more precise and practical to field conditions. The average adjusted Kc values were 0.71 (range of 0.43–1.02) for BY1 and 0.84 (range of 0.48–1.22) for LJ43. Additionally, heavy pruning can decrease ETc and Kc values, possibly due to the lower level of LAI after pruning. Moreover, it is clearly manifested that BY1 consistently had lower ETc and Kc values than those of LJ43 because of plant growth status differences between BY1 and LJ43. Overall, our study proposed a reliable reference of Kc in tea plantation, and illuminated the effects of pruning and plant growth differences on Kc, which could provide a strong basis for precise irrigation in tea plantations in a subtropical climate.

AB  - Applications of modern micro-irrigation methods are inevitable for optimum water use due to the limitations imposed by irrigation water resource scarcity. Regardless of water shortages and associated challenges in dry areas, the irrigation of date palm trees consumes an excessive quantity of water annually using conventional irrigation methods. Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of modern surface and subsurface micro-irrigation systems, i.e., subsurface drip irrigation (SSDI), controlled surface irrigation (CSI), and surface drip-irrigation methods (SDI), with different irrigation water regimes, i.e., 50%, 75%, and 100% irrigation water requirements (IWRs), on the yield and fruit quality of date palms (cv. Khalas) and water conservation in the dryland region of Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. The effects of three irrigation methods and IWRs were studied on macronutrients and soil chemical properties at three depths (0–30, 30–60, and 60–90 cm), as well as on water productivity, yield, and the fruit quality of date palms. The study was carried out over two years and was designed using a two-factorial randomized complete block design (RCBD) with nine replications. The results indicated that electrical conductivity (EC) increased as the depth of the soil increased. The soil chemical properties did not change much in all experimental treatments, while soil pH values decreased with the soil depth from 0–30 to 60–90 cm. Although the maximum fruit yield (96.62 kg palm−1) was recorded when 100% irrigation water was applied in the SSDI system, other treatment combinations, such as SDI at 100% IWR (84.86 kg palm−1), SSDI at 75% IWR (84.84 kg palm−1), and CSI at 100% IWR (83.86 kg palm−1) behaved alike and showed promising results. Similarly, the highest irrigation water productivity (2.11 kg m−3) was observed in the SSDI system at 50% IWR, followed by the SSDI at 75% IWR (1.64 kg m−3) and 100% IWR (1.40 kg m−3). Fruit quality attributes were also promoted with the SSDI system at 75% IWR. Hence, the SSDI method at 75% IWR appeared to be an optimal choice for date palm irrigation in arid areas due to its positive impact on water conservation and fruit characteristics without affecting soil chemical properties.

AB  - In the realm of agriculture, biodegradable films are emerging as a promising substitute for traditional polyethylene (PE) films. Despite their potential, there has been a notable lack of extensive research on their effectiveness in the context of dry direct-seeded rice cultivation. Addressing this gap, a comprehensive biennial study was conducted in the northeastern regions of China, focusing on the ‘Baonong 5’ rice variety. This study meticulously compared three distinct cultivation methods: (1) employing biodegradable film mulching, (2) using conventional plastic film mulching, and (3) cultivating without any mulch. The findings revealed that biodegradable film mulching significantly enhanced soil moisture control, increased leaf area, and improved rice yield and water utilization efficiency (p < 0.05) compared to the plots without mulch. Notably, there was no marked difference in outcomes between the plastic film mulching and the unmulched plots. This research underscores the profound benefits of biodegradable film in rice cultivation, particularly from an environmental sustainability perspective. This innovative method not only boosts agricultural productivity but also addresses critical environmental challenges like climate change and water conservation. The application of biodegradable mulch has proven to be remarkably effective in improving irrigation efficiency and crop water conservation, leading to enhanced rice development and higher yields. The study recorded a substantial increase in water productivity—30% in 2021 and between 52.85% and 60% in 2022—compared to traditional cultivation practices. Furthermore, the use of biodegradable mulch resulted in significantly higher rice yields than the non-mulched plots, thus contributing to increased profitability. Such methods not only yield higher crop outputs but also mitigate environmental issues like water pollution and help alleviate prevalent water shortages in rice farming.

AB  - Future trends in climate change, water scarcity, and energy costs will motivate agriculturists to develop innovative agricultural systems. In order to achieve sustainable farming in arid regions, there is an urgent need to use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict and estimate the optimum water and energy requirements for the irrigation of date palms. Therefore, this study aimed to predict the optimum water and energy requirements for date palm irrigation depending on the optimum water use efficiency (WUE) and yield in arid conditions. To achieve this aim, four solar-powered micro irrigation systems were developed and evaluated under six irrigation levels for date palm irrigation. Soil moisture sensor-based controllers were used to automate irrigation scheduling for the micro irrigation systems. The water pumping in these systems was powered using a solar photovoltaic (PV) system. In addition, four machine-learning (ML) algorithms, including linear regression (LR), support vector regression (SVR), long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were developed and validated for prediction purposes. These models were developed in Python programing language using the Keras library. The results indicated that the optimum WUS was achieved when the maximum setpoints of irrigation control were adjusted at the field capacity and by adjusting the minimum setpoints at 40, 50, 70, and 80% of the available water (AW). The optimum yield was achieved by adjusting the minimum setpoints at 60, 70, 80, and 90% of AW for subsurface irrigation, subsurface drip irrigation, drip irrigation, and bubbler irrigation, respectively. Therefore, the dataset was prepared at these levels for four years to train and test the models, and a fifth year was used to validate the performance of the best model. The evaluation of the models showed that the LSTM followed by XGBoost models were more accurate than the SVR and LR models for predicting the optimum irrigation water and energy requirements. The validation result showed that the LSTM was able to predict the water and energy requirements for all irrigation systems with R2 ranging from 0.90 to 0.92 based on limited meteorological variables and date palm age. The findings of the current study demonstrated that the developed LSTM model can be a powerful tool in irrigation water and energy management as a fast and easy-to-use approach.

AB  - The date palm mite (DPM), Oligonychus afrasiaticus (McGregor), is a key pest of unripe date fruits. The detection of this mite depends largely on the visual observations of the webs it produces on the green fruits. One of the most important problems of DPM control is the lack of an accurate decision-making approach for monitoring and predicting infestation on date fruits. Therefore, this study aimed to develop, evaluate, and validate prediction models for DPM infestation on fruits based on meteorological variables (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation) and the physicochemical properties of date fruits (weight, firmness, moisture content, total soluble solids, total sugar, and tannin content) using two machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., linear regression (LR) and decision forest regression (DFR). The meteorological variables data in the study area were acquired using an IoT-based weather station. The physicochemical properties of two popular date palm cultivars, i.e., Khalas and Barhee, were analyzed at different fruit development stages. The development and performance of the LR and DFR prediction models were implemented using Microsoft Azure ML. The evaluation of the developed models indicated that the DFR was more accurate than the LR model in predicting the DPM based on the input variables, i.e., meteorological variables (R2 = 0.842), physicochemical properties variables (R2 = 0.895), and the combination of both meteorological and the physicochemical properties variables (R2 = 0.921). Accordingly, the developed DFR model was deployed as a fully functional prediction web service into the Azure cloud platform and the Excel add-ins. The validation of the deployed DFR model showed that it was able to predict the DPM count on date palm fruits based on the combination of meteorological and physicochemical properties variables (R2 = 0.918). The deployed DFR model by the web service of Azure Ml studio enhanced the prediction of the DPM count on the date fruits as a fast and easy-to-use approach. These findings demonstrated that the DFR model using Azure Ml Studio integrated into the Azure platform can be a powerful tool in integrated DPM management.

AB  - Food and nutrition are a steadfast essential to all living organisms. With specific reference to humans, the sufficient and efficient supply of food is a challenge as the world population continues to grow. Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be identified as a plausible technology in this 5th industrial revolution in bringing us closer to achieving zero hunger by 2030—Goal 2 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG). This goal cannot be achieved unless the digital divide among developed and underdeveloped countries is addressed. Nevertheless, developing and underdeveloped regions fall behind in economic resources; however, they harbor untapped potential to effectively address the impending demands posed by the soaring world population. Therefore, this study explores the in-depth potential of AI in the agriculture sector for developing and under-developed countries. Similarly, it aims to emphasize the proven efficiency and spin-off applications of AI in the advancement of agriculture. Currently, AI is being utilized in various spheres of agriculture, including but not limited to crop surveillance, irrigation management, disease identification, fertilization practices, task automation, image manipulation, data processing, yield forecasting, supply chain optimization, implementation of decision support system (DSS), weed control, and the enhancement of resource utilization. Whereas AI supports food safety and security by ensuring higher crop yields that are acquired by harnessing the potential of multi-temporal remote sensing (RS) techniques to accurately discern diverse crop phenotypes, monitor land cover dynamics, assess variations in soil organic matter, predict soil moisture levels, conduct plant biomass modeling, and enable comprehensive crop monitoring. The present study identifies various challenges, including financial, infrastructure, experts, data availability, customization, regulatory framework, cultural norms and attitudes, access to market, and interdisciplinary collaboration, in the adoption of AI for developing nations with their subsequent remedies. The identification of challenges and opportunities in the implementation of AI could ignite further research and actions in these regions; thereby supporting sustainable development.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence is quickly emerging as a technological solution for the agriculture industry to surmount its classical challenges. Artificial Intelligence is facilitating farmers to refine their products and alleviate unfavourable impacts due to the environment. The central concern of this paper is predictive analytics to develop a machine learning model to identify and predict crop yield based on multiple environmental factors. In this paper, a hybrid learner ‘RaNN’ is proposed that combines the feature sampling and majority voting technique of Random Forest in-combination with the multilayer Feedforward Neural Network to predict the crop yield. Research has also ascertained the essential features responsible for accurate yield prediction. The proposed model works for rice yield prediction, one of the chief grains of India. The region chosen for the work is Punjab, which is among the largest producer states of India for rice. The dataset consists of 15 attributes comprising the weather and agriculture data collected from the Indian Meteorological Department Pune, and Punjab Environment Information System (ENVIS) Center, Government of India. The study has also made a comparative assessment of ‘RaNN’ with machine learning methods like Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Boosting Regression, Support Vector Machine Regression, Ensemble Learner, and Artificial Neural Network. Our model RaNN has listed a better prediction accuracy with minimal error among the other techniques providing a 98% correlation between the actual and the predicted yield.

AB  - The scarcity of clean water resources around the globe has generated a need for their optimum utilization. Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, based on the application specific sensors’ data acquisition and intelligent processing, are bridging the gaps between the cyber and physical worlds. IoT based smart irrigation management systems can help in achieving optimum water-resource utilization in the precision farming landscape. This paper presents an open-source technology based smart system to predict the irrigation requirements of a field using the sensing of ground parameter like soil moisture, soil temperature, and environmental conditions along with the weather forecast data from the Internet. The sensing nodes, involved in the ground and environmental sensing, consider soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature, Ultraviolet (UV) light radiation, and relative humidity of the crop field. The intelligence of the proposed system is based on a smart algorithm, which considers sensed data along with the weather forecast parameters like precipitation, air temperature, humidity, and UV for the near future. The complete system has been developed and deployed on a pilot scale, where the sensor node data is wirelessly collected over the cloud using web-services and a web-based information visualization and decision support system provides the real-time information insights based on the analysis of sensors data and weather forecast data. The system has a provision for a closed-loop control of the water supply to realize a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. The paper describes the system and discusses in detail the information processing results of three weeks data based on the proposed algorithm. The system is fully functional and the prediction results are very encouraging.

AB  - Over the last decade, the combination of both big data and machine learning research area's receiving considerable attention and expedite the prospect of the agricultural industry. This research aims to gain insights into a state-of-the-art big data application in smart farming. An essential issue for agriculture planning is to estimate evapotranspiration accurately because it plays a pivotal role in irrigation water scheduling for using water efficiently. This article presents H2O model framework to determine the daily ETo for Hoshiarpur and Patiala districts of Punjab. The effects of four supervised learning algorithms: Deep Learning-Multilayer Perceptrons (DL), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient-Boosting Machine (GBM) and also evaluate the overall ability to predict future ETo. Analysis of these four models, perform in H2O framework. This framework presents a new criterion to train, validate, test and improve the classification efficiency using machine learning algorithms. The performance of the DL model is compared with other state-of-art of models such as RF, GLM and GBM. In this respect, our analysis depicts that models presents high performance for modeling daily ETo (e.g. NSE = 0.95–0.98, r2 = 0.95–0.99, ACC = 85–95, MSE = 0.0369–0.1215, RMSE = 0.1921–0.2691).

AB  - After wheat, rice is one of the most important agricultural products in the world, and Iran has a special position here with annual production of more than 2 million t of rice. Evaluation of crop yield has an important role in agricultural policy making due to different conditions and restrictions. Estimating rice yield is a key factor in food security. Any change in the effective parameters can cause changes in rice yield and therefore the food security of the population will be affected. In this study, rice crop yield was estimated by artificial neural networks (ANNs) and ANN-genetic programming (GP) in 2011 and 2015. Rainfall, permeability, soil texture, land type, evapotranspiration and inlet and inflow and outflow water to paddy lands were used as inputs. The results showed that the ANN-GP with a root mean square error (RMSE = 80.8 kg ha‾¹) and a correlation coefficient (CC = 0.91) was more accurate than the stand-alone ANN (with RMSE = 139 kg ha‾¹ and CC = 0.67). Finally, the effect of each input parameter on rice yield was evaluated. Irrigation, drainage and soil type parameters had the best impact rank, with 36, 28 and 31%, respectively. Therefore, the proposed method can act as an efficient tool in estimating rice yield and help decision makers to manage and develop the agricultural system.

AB  - Crop yield is a highly complex trait determined by multiple factors such as genotype, environment, and their interactions. Accurate yield prediction requires fundamental understanding of the functional relationship between yield and these interactive factors, and to reveal such relationship requires both comprehensive datasets and powerful algorithms. In the 2018 Syngenta Crop Challenge, Syngenta released several large datasets that recorded the genotype and yield performances of 2,267 maize hybrids planted in 2,247 locations between 2008 and 2016 and asked participants to predict the yield performance in 2017. As one of the winning teams, we designed a deep neural network (DNN) approach that took advantage of state-of-the-art modeling and solution techniques. Our model was found to have a superior prediction accuracy, with a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) being 12% of the average yield and 50% of the standard deviation for the validation dataset using predicted weather data. With perfect weather data, the RMSE would be reduced to 11% of the average yield and 46% of the standard deviation. We also performed feature selection based on the trained DNN model, which successfully decreased the dimension of the input space without significant drop in the prediction accuracy. Our computational results suggested that this model significantly outperformed other popular methods such as Lasso, shallow neural networks (SNN), and regression tree (RT). The results also revealed that environmental factors had a greater effect on the crop yield than genotype.

AB  - Crop and weeds identification is of important steps towards the development of efficient automotive weed control systems. The higher the accuracy of plant detection and classification, the higher the performance of the weeding machine. In this study, the capability of two popular boosting methods including Adaboost.M1 and LogitBoost algorithms was evaluated to enhance the plant classification performance of four classifiers, namely Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Four feature filtering techniques including Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS), Information Gain (IG), Gain Ratio (GR), and OneR were applied to the image-extracted features and 10 of the most significant features were selected and fed into single and boosted classifiers. The RF model trained by IG selected features (IG-RF) was the most appropriate classifier among the evaluated models whether in single or boosted modes. It was also found that boosting of IG-RF by using Adaboost.M1 and LogitBoost algorithms improved the classification accuracy. Regarding the performance values, the LogitBoost-IG-RF structure, which provided a classification accuracy of 99.58%, a kappa (k) of 0.9948, and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.0688 on training dataset, was selected as the most appropriate classifier for plant discrimination in peanut fields. The accuracy, k, and RMSE criteria of this combination on test dataset were 95.00%, 0.9375, and 0.1591, respectively. It was concluded that combination of boosting algorithms and feature selection methods can promote plant type discrimination accuracy, which is a crucial factor in the development of precision weed control systems.

AB  - The population growth and climate change are making the agricultural sector to seek more accurate and efficient approaches to ensure an adequate and regular supply of food for society with less water consumption. Irrigation management, an essential practice for the development of sustainable agriculture, seeks, through the forecast of Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo), to know in advance the water requirements of crops to plan and manage water resources. However, there is still a gap in the literature regarding the application and evaluation of deep learning models and ensemble models to forecasting reference evapotranspiration in irrigation management. In this context, this paper aims to explore the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the prediction of ETo time series. Three CNNs with different structures were employed to predict a daily time series. Also, in order to evaluate the ensemble forecast of ETo time series, we apply four ensemble models composed of these CNNs in order to produce a probabilistic forecast. This information can be useful for planning and controlling irrigation of crops. Through experimental tests on a real database, the results showed the feasibility of the CNN models for forecasting ETo and that ensemble models were better than the well-known Seasonal ARIMA and Seasonal Naive and improved predictions in terms of variance, precision and computational cost in relation to the individual CNN models, in addition to allowing the estimation of uncertainty, as their outputs are probability distributions. In order to promote reproducibility of this research, all data and codes are publicly available.

AB  - The study of traits in crops enables breeders to guide strategies for selecting and accelerating the progress of genetic breeding. Although the simultaneous evaluation of characteristics in the plant breeding programme provides large quantities of information, identifying which phenotypic characteristic is the most important is a challenge facing breeders. Thus, this work aims to quantify the best approaches for prediction and establish a network of better predictive power in flood-irrigated rice via methodologies based on regression, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Multiple regression, computational intelligence, and machine learning were used to predict the importance of the characteristics. Computational intelligence and machine learning were notable for their ability to extract nonlinear information from model inputs. Predicting the relative contribution of auxiliary characteristics in rice through computational intelligence and machine learning proved to be efficient in determining the relative importance of variables in flood-irrigated rice. The characteristics indicated to assist in decision making are flowering, number of grains filled by panicles and length of panicles for this study. The network with only one hidden layer with 15 neurons was observed to be efficient in determining the relative importance of variables in flooded rice.

AB  - It is widely acknowledged that, under the frame of sustainable farming, using the minimum water resources is a relevant requirement. In order to do that, precision irrigation aims at identifying the irrigation needs of plantations and irrigate accordingly. Artificial intelligence is a promising solution in this field as intelligent models are able to learn the soil moisture dynamics in the soil-plant-atmosphere system and then generating appropriate irrigation scheduling. This is a complex task as the phenology of plants and its water demand vary with soil properties and weather conditions. The present research contributes to this challenging task by proposing the application of neural networks in order to learn the time-series evolution of irrigation needs associated to a potato plantation. Several of such models are thoroughly compared, together with different interpolation methods, in order to find the best combination for accurately forecasting water needs. In order to predict the soil water content in a potato field crop, in which soil humidity probes were installed at 15, 30, and 45 cm depth during the whole cycle of a potato crop. This innovative study and its promising results provide with significant contributions to address the problem of predicting and managing groundwater for agricultural use in a sustainable way.

AB  - Monitoring phenology of agricultural plants is a critical understanding in precision agriculture. Vital improvements can be achieved with precise detection of phenological change of plants which would henceforth improve the timing for the harvest, pest control, yield prediction, farm monitoring, disaster warning etc. Many countries across the world have been developing initiatives to build national agriculture monitoring network systems, since inferring the phenological information contributes to a better understanding of relationships between productivity, vegetation health and environmental conditions. In this paper, we utilize a deep learning architecture to recognize and classify phenological stages of several types of plants purely based on the visual data captured every half an hour by cameras mounted on the ground agro-stations that have been planted all over Turkey as part of an agriculture monitoring network system. A pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network architecture (CNN) is employed to automatically extract the features of images. In order to evaluate the performance of the approach proposed in this paper, the results obtained through CNN model are compared with those obtained by employing hand crafted feature descriptors. Experimental results suggest that CNN architecture outperforms the machine learning algorithms based on hand crafted features for the discrimination of phenological stages.

AB  - Enhancing crop output and streamlining irrigation techniques can be achieved through the potential application of artificial intelligence (AI) in agriculture. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to forecast crop irrigation needs before notable rainfall occurrences are examined in this work. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can precisely estimate agricultural irrigation demands based on expected precipitation by using machine learning algorithms and weather data. To provide accurate irrigation suggestions, the suggested AI system takes into account past weather patterns, soil moisture levels, crop traits, and other pertinent parameters. By taking a proactive stance, farmers may minimize water waste, save important resources, and make well-informed decisions about irrigation management.

AB  - India is primarily an agrarian society and it is important to develop various irrigation techniques as the nature of soil varies drastically spatially. Irrigation scheduling are mainly depends upon monitoring of soil, crop, water available and weather conditions. Major limitation of this system is the under-irrigation or over-irrigation, which affects the SAR ratio of soil or excess runoff generation respectively. Effective implementation of irrigation technique is required to enhance the productivity of less fertile soil. Irrigation with variable rate and intelligent control-based system is required for the enhancement of irrigation system and higher crop yield. Study was conducted for the performance evaluation of irrigation system using ANN and Fuzzy Logic Toolbox of MATLAB. Moisture available, rainfall, evapotranspiration and water supply for wheat crop were taken as input and output variable were performance of irrigation system. Results of different irrigation techniques were evaluated and best technique were identified under their specification.

AB  - The incorporation of advanced technologies into Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) platforms have enabled many practical applications in Precision Agriculture (PA) over the past decade. These PA tools offer capabilities that increase agricultural productivity and inputs’ efficiency and minimize operational costs simultaneously. However, these platforms also have some constraints that limit the application of UAVs in agricultural operations. The constraints include limitations in providing imagery of adequate spatial and temporal resolutions, dependency on weather conditions, and geometric and radiometric correction requirements. In this paper, a practical guide on technical characterizations of common types of UAVs used in PA is presented. This paper helps select the most suitable UAVs and on-board sensors for different agricultural operations by considering all the possible constraints. Over a hundred research studies were reviewed on UAVs applications in PA and practical challenges in monitoring and mapping field crops. We concluded by providing suggestions and future directions to overcome challenges in optimizing operational proficiency.

AB  - Water scarcity is an escalating global concern that poses significant challenges to agriculture. The need to feed a growing population, coupled with changing climate patterns, demands a re-evaluation of water use efficiency in major field crops. Water efficiency in agriculture is a critical facet of sustainable water management in rural areas, where agriculture often serves as a primary economic activity. In rural regions, where water resources are often limited, efficient agricultural water management is vital to ensure food security, economic stability, and environmental sustainability. In this review, we have discussed various measures to improve water use efficiency or productivity in agricultural systems. Adopting the strategies for enhancing water productivity at plant and field level may include: rain water harvesting in rural area, soil moisture conservation practices like mulching, crop residue retention and conservation agriculture, better utilization of stored soil moisture by best crop management interventions, irrigation scheduling, integrated farming systems i.e. multiple usage of water in agriculture by combining various farm enterprises like crop production, dairy and fishery. Beside these, reviewed the water use efficiency for important field crops around the world. Review also discussed about how beneficial public policies particularly watershed management in rural area are needed to establish the right socioeconomic conditions for boosting WUE in the agriculture.

AB  - In this study, we set up a new drone-borne ground-penetrating radar (GPR) for soil moisture mapping. The whole radar system weighs 1.5 kg and consists of a handheld vector network analyzer (VNA) working as frequency domain radar, a lightweight hybrid horn-dipole antenna covering a wide frequency range (250–2800 MHz), a GPS for positioning, a microcomputer with the controlling application, and a smartphone for remote control. Soil moisture is derived from the radar data using full-wave inverse modeling based on the radar equation of Lambot et al. and multilayered media Green's functions. The inversion is performed in the time domain and focuses on the surface reflection. The antenna-drone system is characterized by global reflection and transmission functions which are determined through a calibration procedure. We performed drone-GPR measurements over three different agricultural fields in the loess belt region of Belgium. In this study, we used the 500–700 MHz range to avoid soil surface roughness effects and to focus on the top 10–20 cm of the soil. These fields present a range of landform conditions leading to specific soil moisture distributions. The soil moisture maps were constructed from the local measurements using kriging. The obtained soil moisture maps are in good agreement with the topographical conditions of the fields and aerial orthophotography observations. These results demonstrated the potential and benefits of drone-GPR for fast, high-resolution mapping of soil moisture at the field scale, and to support, e.g., precision agriculture and environmental monitoring.

AB  - This paper introduces the narrow strip irrigation (NSI) method and aims to estimate water-use efficiency (WUE) and yield in apple orchards under NSI in the Miandoab region located southeast of Lake Urmia using a machine learning approach. To perform the estimation, a hybrid method based on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and seasons optimization (SO) algorithm was proposed. According to the irrigation and climate factors, six different models have been proposed to combine the parameters in the SO-ANFIS. The proposed method is evaluated on a test data set that contains information about apple orchards in Miandoab city from 2019 to 2021. The NSI model was compared with two popular irrigation methods including two-sided furrow irrigation (TSFI) and basin irrigation (BI) on benchmark scenarios. The results justified that the NSI model increased WUE by 1.90 kg/m3 and 3.13 kg/m3, and yield by 8.57% and 14.30% compared to TSFI and BI methods, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed SO-ANFIS has achieved the performance of 0.989 and 0.988 in terms of R2 criterion in estimating WUE and yield of NSI irrigation method, respectively. The results confirmed that the SO-ANFIS outperformed the counterpart methods in terms of performance measures.

AB  - Sustainable agricultural practices are required, especially for irrigation, to provide for a growing population. About 85% of the freshwater resources in the world are used for irrigation. “Us,” current irrigation procedures must be either updated or replaced with cutting-edge, intelligent systems that utilize the ML, IoT (Internet of Things), and sensor networks which are wireless. In the proposed paper, a brainy system for tracking and scheduling accuracy irrigation using IoT, a LoRa-based machine learning (ML) is being introduced. We developed an independent irrigation technique that would provide the tomato and eggplant with the precise amount of water they required was set up using the information obtained from the soil moisture sensors. In comparison to traditional watering, which required 7541 mL for the banana plant and 8755 mL for the rice plant, the irrigation system irrigated the plants with an overall quantity of 5010.745 mL & 4421.09 mL in one month. Overall, this led to a 46% reduction in water usage, and the plants looked better than they would have with conventional watering. The simulation results clearly show that the suggested approach uses water more sensibly than cutting-edge models in the experiment farming region.

AB  - Water management is one of the crucial topics discussed in most of the international forums. Water harvesting and recycling are the major requirements to meet the global upcoming demand of the water crisis, which is prevalent. To achieve this, we need more emphasis on water management techniques that are applied across various categories of the applications. Keeping in mind the population density index, there is a dire need to implement intelligent water management mechanisms for effective distribution, conservation and to maintain the water quality standards for various purposes. The prescribed work discusses about few major areas of applications that are required for efficient water management. Those are recent trends in wastewater recycle, water distribution, rainwater harvesting and irrigation management using various Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. The data acquired for these applications are purely unique and also differs by type. Hence, there is a dire need to use a model or algorithm that can be applied to provide solutions across all these applications. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques along with the Internet of things (IoT) framework can facilitate in designing a smart water management system for sustainable water usage from natural resources. This work surveys various water management techniques and the use of AI/DL along with the IoT network and case studies, sample statistical analysis to develop an efficient water management framework.

AB  - Monitoring crop residue cover (CRC) is one of the most important issues to achieve sustainable agriculture. Generally, it can be possible using remote sensing technology. New tools for remote sensing are regularly introduced by advancement of technology. In this study we used Landsat 8 OLI data plus images captured by a drone above the selected plots for remote sensing of CRC. For the remote sensing trails, a total of 23 indices were used to identify the CRC, of which 6 index; dead fuel index (DFI), Normalized difference tillage index (NDTI), Simple tillage index (STI), RATIO, Normalized difference index (NDI3), and NDI4 showed acceptable correlations with the CRC and DFI with R2 = 0.96 was the highest. Among the images captured by drone, those images taken from 10-meters height, showed acceptable correlation results up to 0.84, based on the three the RGB based indices; (R-G)/(G-B), 2×G-R-B and G/(R+G+B). Similar to satellite imaging, drone captured images can be used to estimate amount of CRC. This study showed that results from Landsat 8 OLI imagery is slightly more accurate than drone imagery for estimating CRC, however there are certain advantages associated with drone imagery including lower expenses, easy access and more control over data range desired plus more spatial and temporal resolutions.

AB  - The use of sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) is key to moving the world’s agriculture to a more productive and sustainable path. Recent advancements in IoT, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have the potential to address some of the environmental, economic, and technical challenges as well as opportunities in this sector. As the number of interconnected devices continues to grow, this generates more big data with multiple modalities and spatial and temporal variations. Intelligent processing and analysis of this big data are necessary to developing a higher level of knowledge base and insights that results in better decision making, forecasting, and reliable management of sensors. This paper is a comprehensive review of the application of different machine learning algorithms in sensor data analytics within the agricultural ecosystem. It further discusses a case study on an IoT based data-driven smart farm prototype as an integrated food, energy, and water (FEW) system.

AB  - Plant diseases are considered one of the main factors influencing food production and minimize losses in production, and it is essential that crop diseases have fast detection and recognition. The recent expansion of deep learning methods has found its application in plant disease detection, offering a robust tool with highly accurate results. In this context, this work presents a systematic review of the literature that aims to identify the state of the art of the use of convolutional neural networks(CNN) in the process of identification and classification of plant diseases, delimiting trends, and indicating gaps. In this sense, we present 121 papers selected in the last ten years with different approaches to treat aspects related to disease detection, characteristics of the data set, the crops and pathogens investigated. From the results of the systematic review, it is possible to understand the innovative trends regarding the use of CNNs in the identification of plant diseases and to identify the gaps that need the attention of the research community.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ETo) forecasts can play an important role in irrigation scheduling and water resource management. Three state-of-the-art deep learning models, including long short-term memory (LSTM), one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN), and convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), were tested to forecast ETo on a daily time scale for seven days period. Daily air temperature (maximum, minimum and mean values), solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed data were collected for the 2011–2017 period from three weather stations (Harrington, North Cape, and Saint Peters) across Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada. The relative importance method was used to determine the best-suited input variables for the models. The deep learning models were evaluated with the walk-forward validation technique using statistical measures of root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). The FAO Penman–Monteith modified equation (FAO-56) was used as the reference method for comparison purposes. For calibration and validation evaluation in annually daily ETo forecasts, the hybrid ConvLSTM model recorded lower errors than CNN and LSTM with the lowest calibration and validation daily RMSE of 0.64 and 0.62, 0.81 and 0.81, and 0.81 and 0.70 mm/day for Harrington, North Cape, and Saint Peters weather stations, respectively. The robustness and accuracy of these forecasted models may help farmers, water resource managers, and irrigation planners with improved and sustainable water management at the basin level, and for irrigation scheduling at farm/field level.

AB  - Daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) forecasts can help farmers in irrigation planning. Therefore, this study assesses the potential of deep learning (long short-term memory (LSTM), one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) and a combination of the two previous models (CNN-LSTM)) and traditional machine learning models (artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF)), in regional and local scenarios, to forecast multi-step ahead daily ETo (seven days) using iterated, direct and multiple input multiple output (MIMO) forecasting strategies. Three input data combinations were assessed: (1) only lagged ETo; (2) lagged ETo + day of the year of each step of the time lag considered; and (3) the same of input combination 2 + lagged meteorological variables. Data from 53 weather stations located in Minas Gerais, Brazil, were used. Four stations were used as test stations. Two baselines were also employed: (B1), all the forecasting horizon is considered equal to the mean ETo measured during the last seven days; and (B2), ahead ETo values are considered equal to their respective historical monthly means. In general, MIMO was the best forecasting strategy, offering good performance and lower computational cost. The deep learning models performed slightly better than the machine learning models, and both were better than the best baseline (B2), mainly on the first and second forecasting days. Among the deep learning models, CNN-LSTM2 (i.e., CNN-LSTM with input combination 2) performed the best in local scenario (mean RMSE over the prediction horizon and stations equal to 0.87), and CNN-LSTM3 performed the best in regional scenario (mean RMSE equal to 0.88). The regional models are recommended instead of the local models since they exhibited similar performances and have higher generalization capacity. Finally, although the models developed have not exhibited high accuracies, they can be useful tools in places where historical monthly mean ETo is used to forecast ETo.

AB  - The coefficients of uniformity Christiansen's uniformity coefficient (CU) and distribution uniformity (DU) are an important parameter for designing irrigation systems, and are an accurate measure for water lose. In this study, three machine learning algorithms Random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and random forest-extreme gradient boosting (XGB-RF) were developed to predict the water distribution uniformity based on operating pressure, heights of sprinkler, discharge, nozzle diameter, wind speed, humidity, highest and lowest temperature for three different impact sprinklers (KA-4, FOX and 2520) for square and triangular system layout based on four scenarios (input combinations). The main findings were; the highest CU value was 86.7% in the square system of 2520 sprinkler under 200 kPa, 0.5 m height and 0.855 m3/h (Nozzle 2.5 mm). Meanwhile, in the triangular system, it was 87.3% under the same pressure and discharge and 1 m height. For applied machine learning, the highest values of R2 were 0.796, 0.825 and 0.929 in RF, XGB and XGB-RF respectively in the first scenario for CU. Moreover, for the DU, the highest values of R2 were 0.701, 0.479 and 0.826 in RF, XGB and XGB-RF respectively in the first scenario. The obtained results revealed that the sprinkler height had the lowest impact on modeling of the water distribution uniformity.

AB  - Precision irrigation represents those strategies aiming to feed the plant needs following the soil’s spatial and temporal characteristics. Such a differential irrigation requires a different approach and equipment with regard to conventional irrigation to reduce the environmental impact and the resources use while maximizing the production and thus profitability. This study described the development of an open source soil moisture LoRa (long‐range) device and analysis of the data collected and updated directly in the field (i.e., weather station and ground sensor). The work produced adaptive supervised predictive models to optimize the management of agricultural precision irrigation practices and for an effective calibration of other agronomic interventions. These approaches are defined as adaptive because they self‐learn with the acquisition of new data, updating the on‐the‐go model over time. The location chosen for the experimental setup is a cultivated area in the municipality of Tenna (Trentino, Alto Adige region, Italy), and the experiment was conducted on two different apple varieties during summer 2019. The adaptative partial least squares time‐lag time‐series modeling, in operative field conditions, was a posteriori applied in the consortium for 78 days during the dry season, producing total savings of 255 mm of irrigated water and 44,000 kW of electricity, equal to 10.82%.

AB  - Drought is the most severe problem for agricultural production, and the intensity of this problem is increasing in most cultivated areas around the world. Hence improving water productivity is the primary purpose of sustainable agriculture. This study aimed to use cloud IoT solutions to control a modern subsurface irrigation system for improving irrigation management of date palms in arid regions. To achieve this goal, we designed, constructed, and validated the performance of a fully automated controlled subsurface irrigation system (CSIS) to monitor and control the irrigation water amount remotely. The CSIS is based on an autonomous sensors network to instantly collect the climatic parameters and volumetric soil water content in the study area. Therefore, we employed the ThingSpeak cloud platform to host sensor readings, perform algorithmic analysis, instant visualize the live data, create event-based alerts to the user, and send instructions to the IoT devices. The validation of the CSIS proved that automatically irrigating date palm trees controlled by the sensor-based irrigation scheduling (S-BIS) is more efficient than the time-based irrigation scheduling (T-BIS). The S-BIS provided the date palm with the optimum irrigation water amount at the opportune time directly in the functional root zone. Generally, the S-BIS and T-BIS of CSIS reduced the applied irrigation water amount by 64.1% and 61.2%, respectively, compared with traditional surface irrigation (TSI). The total annual amount of applied irrigation water for CSIS with S-BIS method, CSIS with T-BIS method, and TSI was 21.04, 22.76, and 58.71 m3 palm−1, respectively. The water productivity at the CSIS with S-BIS (1.783 kg m−3 ) and T-BIS (1.44 kg m−3 ) methods was significantly higher compared to the TSI (0.531 kg m−3 ). The CSIS with the S-BIS method kept the volumetric water content in the functional root zone next to the field capacity compared to the T-BIS method. The deigned CSIS with the S-BIS method characterized by the positive impact on the irrigation water management and enhancement on fruit yield of the date palm is quite proper for date palm irrigation in the arid regions.

AB  - Application of computer vision and robotics in agriculture requires sufficient knowledge and understanding of the physical properties of the object of interest. Yield monitoring is an example where these properties affect the quantified estimation of yield mass. In this study, we propose an image-processing and artificial intelligence-based system using multi-class detection with instance-wise segmentation of fruits in an image that can further estimate dimensions and mass. We analyze a tomato image dataset with mass and dimension values collected using a calibrated vision system and accurate measuring devices. After successful detection and instance-wise segmentation, we extract the real-world dimensions of the fruit. Our characterization results exhibited a significantly high correlation between dimensions and mass, indicating that artificial intelligence algorithms can effectively capture this complex physical relation to estimate the final mass. We also compare different artificial intelligence algorithms to show that the computed mass agrees well with the actual mass. Detection and segmentation results show an average mask intersection over union of 96.05%, mean average precision of 92.28%, detection accuracy of 99.02%, and precision of 99.7%. The mean absolute percentage error for mass estimation was 7.09 for 77 test samples using a bagged ensemble tree regressor. This approach could be applied to other computer vision and robotic applications such as sizing and packaging systems and automated harvesting or to other measuring instruments.

AB  - This research proposes a decision support system for weir sluice gate level adjusting. The proposed system, named AWARD (Appropriate Weir Adjustment with Water Requirement Deliberation), is composed of three modules, which are (1) water level prediction, (2) sluice gates setting period estimation, and (3) sluice gates level adjusting calculation. The AWARD system applies an artificial neural network technique for water level prediction, a fuzzy logic control algorithm for sluice gate setting period estimation, and hydraulics equations for sluice gate level adjusting. The water requirements and supplies are deducted from the field-survey and telemetry stations in Chiang Rai Province, Thailand. The results show that the proposed system can accurately estimate the water volume. Water level prediction shows high accuracy. The standard error of prediction (SEP) is 2.58 cm and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 7.38%. The sluice gate setting period is practically adjusted. The sluice gate level is adjusted according to the water requirement.

AB  - Automatic irrigation scheduling systems are highly demanded in the agricultural sector due to their ability to both save water and manage deficit irrigation strategies. Elaborating a functional and efficient automatic irrigation system is a very complex task due to the high number of factors that the technician considers when managing irrigation in an optimal way. Automatic learning systems propose an alternative to traditional irrigation management by means of the automatic elaboration of predictions based on the learning of an agronomist (DSS). The aim of this paper is the study of several learning techniques in order to determine the goodness and error relative to expert decision. Nine orchards were tested during 2018 using linear regression (LR), random forest regression (RFR), and support vector regression (SVR) methods as engines of the irrigation decision support system (IDSS) proposed. The results obtained by the learning methods in three of these orchards have been compared with the decisions made by the agronomist over an entire year. The prediction model errors determined the best fitting regression model. The results obtained lead to the conclusion that these methods are valid engines to develop automatic irrigation scheduling systems.

AB  - The increase in population growth and demand is rapidly depleting natural resources. Irrigation plays a vital role in the productivity and growth of agriculture, consuming no less than 75% of fresh water utilization globally. Irrigation, being the largest consumer of water across the globe, needs refinements in its process, and because it is implemented by individuals (farmers), the use of water for irrigation is not effective. To enhance irrigation management, farmers need to keep track of information such as soil type, climatic conditions, available water resources, soil pH, soil nutrients, and soil moisture to make decisions that resolve or prevent agricultural complexity. Irrigation, a data-driven technology, requires the integration of emerging technologies and modern methodologies to provide solutions to the complex problems faced by agriculture. The paper is an overview of IoT-enabled modern technologies through which irrigation management can be elevated. This paper presents the evolution of irrigation and IoT, factors to be considered for effective irrigation, the need for effective irrigation optimization, and how dynamic irrigation optimization would help reduce water use. The paper also discusses the different IoT architecture and deployment models, sensors, and controllers used in the agriculture field, available cloud platforms for IoT, prominent tools or software used for irrigation scheduling and water need prediction, and machine learning and neural network models for irrigation. Convergence of the tools, technologies and approaches helps in the development of better irrigation management applications. Access to real-time data, such as weather, plant and soil data, must be enhanced for the development of effective irrigation management applications.

AB  - Irrigated agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater globally. Despite the clarity of influential factors and deriving forces, estimation of the volumetric irrigation demand using biophysical models is prohibitively difficult. Data-driven models have proven their ability to predict geophysical and hydrological phenomena with only a handful of influential input variables; however, the lack of reliable input data in most agricultural regions of the world hinders the effectiveness of these approaches. Attempting to estimate the irrigation water demand, we first analyze the correlation of potential influencing variables with irrigation water. We develop machine learning models to predict California’s annual, county-level irrigation water demand based on the statistical analysis findings over an 18-year time span. Input variables are different combinations of deriving meteorological forces, geographical characteristics, cropped area, and crop category. After testing various regression machine learning approaches, the result shows that Gaussian process regression produces the best results. Our findings suggest that irrigated cropped area, air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit are the most significant variables in predicting irrigation water demand. This research also shows that Gaussian process regression can predict irrigation water demand with high accuracy (R2 higher than 0.97 and RMSE as low as 0.06 km3) with different input variable combinations. An accurate estimation of irrigation water use of various crop categories and areas can assist decision-making processes and improve water management strategies. The proposed model can help water policy makers evaluate climatological and agricultural scenarios and hence be used as a decision support tool for agricultural water management at a regional scale.

AB  - Yield prediction is of great significance for yield mapping, crop market planning, crop insurance, and harvest management. Remote sensing is becoming increasingly important in crop yield prediction. Based on remote sensing data, great progress has been made in this field by using machine learning, especially the Deep Learning (DL) method, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Recent experiments in this area suggested that CNN can explore more spatial features and LSTM has the ability to reveal phenological characteristics, which both play an important role in crop yield prediction. However, very few experiments combining these two models for crop yield prediction have been reported. In this paper, we propose a deep CNN-LSTM model for both end-of-season and in-season soybean yield prediction in CONUS at the county-level. The model was trained by crop growth variables and environment variables, which include weather data, MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) data, and MODIS Surface Reflectance (SR) data; historical soybean yield data were employed as labels. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), all these training data were combined and transformed into histogram-based tensors for deep learning. The results of the experiment indicate that the prediction performance of the proposed CNN-LSTM model can outperform the pure CNN or LSTM model in both end-of-season and in-season. The proposed method shows great potential in improving the accuracy of yield prediction for other crops like corn, wheat, and potatoes at fine scales in the future.

AB  - Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) learn representation from data with an impressive capability, and brought important breakthroughs for processing images, time-series, natural language, audio, video, and many others. In the remote sensing field, surveys and literature revisions specifically involving DNNs algorithms’ applications have been conducted in an attempt to summarize the amount of information produced in its subfields. Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based applications have dominated aerial sensing research. However, a literature revision that combines both “deep learning” and “UAV remote sensing” thematics has not yet been conducted. The motivation for our work was to present a comprehensive review of the fundamentals of Deep Learning (DL) applied in UAV-based imagery. We focused mainly on describing the classification and regression techniques used in recent applications with UAV-acquired data. For that, a total of 232 papers published in international scientific journal databases was examined. We gathered the published materials and evaluated their characteristics regarding the application, sensor, and technique used. We discuss how DL presents promising results and has the potential for processing tasks associated with UAV-based image data. Lastly, we project future perspectives, commentating on prominent DL paths to be explored in the UAV remote sensing field. This revision consisting of an approach to introduce, commentate, and summarize the state-of-the-art in UAV-based image applications with DNNs algorithms in diverse subfields of remote sensing, grouping it in the environmental, urban, and agricultural contexts.

AB  - Presently, saving natural resources is increasingly a concern, and water scarcity is a fact that has been occurring in more areas of the globe. One of the main strategies used to counter this trend is the use of new technologies. On this topic, the Internet of Things has been highlighted, with these solutions being characterized by offering robustness and simplicity, while being low cost. This paper presents the study and development of an automatic irrigation control system for agricultural fields. The developed solution had a wireless sensors and actuators network, a mobile application that offers the user the capability of consulting not only the data collected in real time but also their history and also act in accordance with the data it analyses. To adapt the water management, Machine Learning algorithms were studied to predict the best time of day for water administration. Of the studied algorithms (Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Support Vectors Machines) the one that obtained the best results was Random Forest, presenting an accuracy of 84.6%. Besides the ML solution, a method was also developed to calculate the amount of water needed to manage the fields under analysis. Through the implementation of the system it was possible to realize that the developed solution is effective and can achieve up to 60% of water savings.
